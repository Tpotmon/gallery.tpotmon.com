  "description": "DrunkRick is a lowbie tier coder with 35 HP, reflecting modest influence and visibility. The ability mocks their fixation on the 'dead internet theory' and niche coding culture, ironically highlighting how their content confuses more than helps. The attack references their frequent themed tweets about late-night debugging and coding struggles, roasted as chaotic and cringe-worthy. The attack type is 'cringe' due to awkward and niche humor typical in their posts. They are weak to 'roast' because sharp criticism can pierce their self-deprecating humor and expose their limited reach. Resistant to 'psyop' since their cerebral, tech-savvy audience is less likely to be misled or confused by manipulative content. No furry or other types apply because there is no animal or anthro content, and no strong drama or gaslight elements noted.",
