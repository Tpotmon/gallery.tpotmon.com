  "description": "Sourav's card is designed around his cybersecurity and automotive hacking expertise, reflecting his high knowledge and steady online presence (highbie tier). The ability sarcastically mocks how his complex security tips confuse everyday users. The attack is tied to his prolific posting of detailed technical threads and project shares, overwhelming but not popular enough for huge damage, fitting the psyop type for spreading complex, niche content that manipulates understanding. His weakness to roast suits the fact that sharp criticism or mockery would undermine his serious tech persona. Resistant to psyop means he handles confusing or technical mind games well. There's no furry influence since no animal-themed content is present. The hit points and damage are balanced for a highbie rarity.",
