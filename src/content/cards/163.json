  "description": "Raiku is a highbie tier developer persona with solid hit points (100) reflecting his rare, well-followed but niche tech influence. His ability sarcastically mocks his know-it-all coding attitude that ironically freezes those seeking his advice, reflecting his profile's tech-centric, slightly condescending tone. The attack name and description derive from his frequent snarky, sharp developer commentary and repeated roasting of modern frameworks and developer culture, hitting hard with a roasting type attack. Raiku's weakness to drama suits because emotional controversies or conflicts can unnerve the typically logical coder persona he projects online. He resists roast type attacks well because his whole brand is built on sharp biting commentary, making him hardened to similar critiques.",
