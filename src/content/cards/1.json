  "description": "This card reflects kiyoshi ?¿'s high-tier status with solid HP and a powerful drama-type attack inspired by their frequent emotional rollercoaster tweets and work struggles. The ability sarcastically mocks their endless grind and frequent posts about working hard yet not making money, as shown in multiple tweets and the exhausting vibe from their timeline. The attack name pokes fun at their rapid mood swings and contradictory statements that cause drama and confusion among followers. The weakness to roast reflects how sharp criticism and ironic commentary would undermine kiyoshi's antics, while resistance to drama reflects their seeming immunity to their own or others' emotional conflicts. The furry type was not chosen since despite some anime and desktop mentions, there is no clear animal or furry community content. The overall design captures the chaotic, tired, and sarcastic tone of kiyoshi's online persona.",
