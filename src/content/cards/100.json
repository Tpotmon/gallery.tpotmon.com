  "description": "flowstate is an AI and tech enthusiast with a high tweet count and decent engagement, marking them as a highbie tier with 100 HP. Their profile and tweets show heavy tech, AI, and productivity themes but also a sense of irony and sarcasm, often involving memes and retweets that lack originality, hence the sarcastic ability '404 Task Not Found'. Their most notable 'attack' is retweeting memes from internet characters like 'KingOfStank', which is ironically 'cringe', reflecting an unoriginal approach. They resist psyop because their technical and logical posts make it hard to confuse or manipulate them. However, they're weak to roast type attacks because their sarcastic and biting tone can be pierced by sharp criticism. No animal or furry content was found, so the furry type wasn't assigned.",
