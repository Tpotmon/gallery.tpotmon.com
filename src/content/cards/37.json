  "description": "deep is a 'nanobie' tier account with modest following and engagement. Their content is introspective, overthinking simple concepts, and often posting about tech projects and college struggles. Ability mocks their tendency to overcomplicate simple insights unintentionally. Attack is based on their habit of convoluting subjects trying to connect topics from college days in a confusing, rambling way. The account shows some resilience to confusion and mind games, hence resistant to psyop, but vulnerable to sharp criticism (roast). No furry or other niche themes were apparent, so psyop fits best given the confusing overthinking style.",
