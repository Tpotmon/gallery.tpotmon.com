  "description": "Ace is a nanobie tier Vtuber focused on gaming streams and a wholesome succuboy persona. Their ability mocks their perpetual caffeine dependence and tendency to delay streaming starts. The attack references their infamous muted audio stream, which was awkward and cringeworthy for viewers. Despite their gentle and mostly wholesome attitude, they are prone to burning out and missing alarms, so they are weak to drama that can emotionally disrupt them. Resistant to cringe attacks thanks to their steady presence despite awkward moments. The presence of a bat emoji and succuboy theme nods to a slight furry connection, but the content is dominated by wholesome gaming and LGBTQ+ acceptance, so the attack type chosen is 'cringe' to reflect awkward stream moments. Overall, a relatable but slightly awkward and inconsistent streamer card.",
