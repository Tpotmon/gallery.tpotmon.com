  "description": "Tier: lowbie card with low HP and damage reflecting moderate influence.\nAbility reflects the user's poetic, melancholic profile and tendency for aimless reflection (walking through fields, longing).\nAttack is based on the standout tweet mocking multi-fandom interest with a violent, excessive metaphor, highlighting their over-the-top posting style - classed as 'cringe' because of awkward dramatic irony.\nWeakness to 'roast' because sharp criticism cuts through their tenuous intellectual facade.\nResistance to 'psyop' since their posts don't focus on manipulation or confusion but more on awkward blunt expression.\nAnimal/furry themes absent despite some nature images; no LGBTQ+ themes embraced but sarcastic remarks about it exist, so no 'gay' type assigned.",
