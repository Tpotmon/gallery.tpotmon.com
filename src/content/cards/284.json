  "description": "The user's profile and tweets revolve around a baby persona with lots of meme-sharing, awkward humor, and attention-seeking posts, fitting the \"cringe\" attack type perfectly. Their ability mocks their childish babbling. Given their low follower count and tier, lower hit points and attack damage are appropriate. Their tweets occasionally show self-promotion and silly antics that would be vulnerable to sharp criticism, making \"roast\" a fitting weakness. The user also shows some resistance to flirtatious or attractive content due to their immaturity and focus on other themes. No furry or LGBTQ+ content was present, so those types were not assigned.",
