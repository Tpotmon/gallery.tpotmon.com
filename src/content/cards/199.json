  "description": "This user is a highbie tier tech-savvy solo developer who enjoys breaking things and posting niche memes. His ability sarcastically jabs at his self-proclaimed legacy of breaking things for over a decade. The attack mocks his constant posting of technical and obscure memes that confuse most people, fitting the 'psyop' type due to the confusing nature of his content. He's weak to roast type attacks because biting commentary ruins his nerdy insider vibe. He resists psyop attacks since he is adept at this confusing, niche content style. No furry elements in his content or images, so furry type not assigned.",
