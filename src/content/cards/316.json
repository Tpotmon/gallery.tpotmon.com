  "description": "Regidna Holo is a lowbie-tier user with moderate followers and high engagement with their positive, enthusiastic, and sometimes awkward content. The ability 'Too Friendly to Function' sarcastically jabs at how their constant friendliness ends up ignored or sidelined. The attack 'Regidna Rave' draws from their persistent flood of cheerleading-style tweets and repetitive greetings, which can annoy others more than inspire. The attack type is 'cringe' since their over-the-top positivity and random silliness often evoke secondhand embarrassment.\n\nWeakness is 'roast' because pointed criticism or sarcastic commentary easily cuts through the saccharine veil. Resistance to 'cringe' reflects that they are already steeped in cringe behavior, so it does less damage. Hit points are low-end within the lowbie range because while they have some followers and engagement, their influence is limited. This balanced view captures their upbeat but awkward Twitter persona.",
