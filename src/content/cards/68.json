  "description": "Since hushhh is a lowbie engineer with a modest following but a very high tweet and retweet count, their ability mirrors their tired, chaotic multitasking and ironic ineffectiveness. Their attack is based on overposting low-engagement, confusing tweets and retweets that cause follower fatigue, fitting the psyop type due to the mixed messaging and annoyance factor. They resist psyop-type attacks because they themselves confuse others and are used to it. Their weakness is roast, as sharp criticism would cut through their scattered persona and call out the lack of meaningful content. Their card HP is low, reflecting low tier and follower count but a decent activity level.",
