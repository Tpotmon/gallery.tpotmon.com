  "attackDescription": "Formerly Rule 11 flexes about not needing money while clearly begging for attention with delusional hype tweets and over-the-top boasts about robots and fresh wheels. Absolute cringe for his own hype train.",

  "description": "Chosen ultrabie tier with high HP due to verified and active status with many tweets. Ability mocks his incessant complex tech jargon and quantum encryption boasts that confuse instead of impress. Attack reflects his overhyped, cringy fundraising refusal and boastful style visible in tweets with little traction. Weak to roasts because his persona is vulnerable to sharp criticism slicing through his fragile hype. Resistant to psyop due to his own cryptic, confusing posts and tech babble which already confuse others.",
