  "description": "Matt is a highbie-tier backend developer with a solid following and a tendency to post tech-related content, memes, and anime references. His ability sarcastically points to the generic and self-referential nature of his posts. The attack is focused on his frequent sharing of overly niche or typo memes which cause cringe, fitting the cringe type. He resists cringe since he posts it himself and is used to it, but is weak to roast as sharp criticism can undermine his comfort zone. The card's HP and attack damage align with his highbie status, and the choice of attack type reflects his posting style rather than aggressive or manipulative behavior. There is no furry or other specialized content to suggest other types.",
