  "description": "Wren's card is built around her trolling and sarcastic behavior aimed at a specific user (@mindworm666). Her relatively low follower count and casual posting style place her HP in the low range (25). The ability mocks her fixation on worms and single parenting references, which dominate her profile. The attack pokes fun at her passive-aggressive, somewhat manipulative style of posting and obsession with an inside joke, fitting the 'psyop' type. She resists psyop attacks due to her own manipulative posting but is weak to roasts that call out her trolling and sarcasm. No animal/furry content was found despite worms mention; her humor leans more towards ironic trolling than actual 'furry' themes, so that type is not assigned.",
