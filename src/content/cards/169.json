  "description": "Given Ayush's megabie tier, he gets high HP and a powerful attack. His ability is a sarcastic jab at his 'life is a race' mantra and tendency to complain ironically. The attack references his sarcastic tweeting style and boredom posts that show he's more about roasting than genuine positivity. He's weak to drama because confrontations about his family blocking policy and emotional tirades can crack his facade. Resistant to roast since he dishes it out confidently and has a high follower count, so criticism bounces off him. No furry or LGBTQ+ content found in profile or media. The overall card reflects his developer, sarcastic, and social media influencer vibe with a strong roast flavor.",
