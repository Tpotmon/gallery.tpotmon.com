  "description": "Jacob is an ultrabie-level coder and tech enthusiast with a rare tier. His ability reflects his extreme overwork and coding endurance, ironically questioning his own sanity. His main attack mocks his excessive retweeting of AI hype and tech trends, overwhelming feeds with confusing info and hype â€” fitting a psyop type. He resists other psyop influences but is weak to goon types who confront and disrupt his tech-bro bubble aggressively. He shows no furry or other thematic animal-related content, so no furry type was assigned despite his tech/AI posts. The hit points reflect his ultrabie tier, giving a solid but not maximum health pool.",
