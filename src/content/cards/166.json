  "description": "Ness is a final year Computer Science student who tweets a lot about programming, college life, and tech humor, often retweeting sarcastic or witty content which fits well with a roast attack type. Their profile picture and banner are straightforward, showing no animal or furry themes, so furry type is not chosen. The user exhibits irony through their sarcastic retweets, earning the sarcastic ability 'Code Whisperer' that pokes fun at their passive-aggressive programming tweets. Their attacks reflect personal and relatable content about coding mishaps and college struggles with a sarcastic tone, hence 'Ness’s Hot Takes'. The highbie tier fits their followers and activity, assigning them 95 hitPoints and a mid-range attack damage of 50. Because they engage in retweets and subtle sarcasm, they resist psyop (mind games/confusion) but are weak to drama-type content, reflecting how emotional conflicts may disrupt their mostly cool, sarcastic veneer.",
