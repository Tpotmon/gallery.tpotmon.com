  "description": "Djcows' ability mocks their ironically scattered presence and blaming the internet for their own ramblings. The attack is drawn from their most popular tweet about 'guns out for yacine,' which despite its emotional intent, comes across as awkward and dramatic. The user is resistant to drama because their timeline thrives on it but weak to psyop since they can be confused and overwhelmed mentally. The ultrabie tier sets the HP and attack damage to the higher range. The 'drama' type fits due to their frequent emotional and controversial tweeting; no furry or LGBTQ+ content was detected despite the cow profile picture, so those types were not chosen.",
