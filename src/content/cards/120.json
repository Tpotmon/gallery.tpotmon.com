  "description": "Exo's profile and content heavily feature AI art, OCs, fanart, and notably cats (including a black cat emoji in their bio and many cat-related tweets), so the 'furry' type is a natural fit for their attack and resistance. Their ability sarcastically mocks their overwhelming flood of AI prompts and fanart, which can drown out meaningful interaction. Despite their strong artistic presence, their weakness to 'roast' type reflects their vulnerability to sharp criticism or biting commentary about their repetitive or niche content. Their high hit points correspond to their ultrabie tier, reflecting a substantial presence on the platform.",
