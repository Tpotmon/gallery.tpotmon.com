  "description": "Pauly is a lowbie tier Leafs fan with moderate engagement. His posts often sarcastically roast hockey players and rival fans, showing a defensive and somewhat bitter tone, perfect for a roast attack type. He also posts animal content (a squirrel video) but minimally, not enough for furry type. His ability sarcastically mocks his own fan loyalty. His weakness is drama, as he reacts strongly to controversies and rival fan conflicts, making emotional conflicts a counter. He resists roast type as he himself uses roasting in posts and handles criticism with blunt sarcasm. The hitpoints are low-medium since the tier is lowbie with decent activity but not dominant.",
