  "description": "With a 'deranged gamedev' and 'shitposter' profile describing lost lunacy, the ability reflects chaotic coding irony. The attack is based on their most viral tweet about 'vibecoding', which garnered massive engagement but is nonsensical to most, fitting the psyop type. Their high follower count and verified ultra tier merits strong HP and attack damage. They resist psyop attacks (confusing/misleading content) but are weak to roast because biting criticism can pierce their lunatic facade.",
