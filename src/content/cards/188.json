  "description": "Tolly is a low-tier tech influencer with a modest following who frequently posts about software, programming, AI, and dad life with a dry, sly humor. His profile and tweets reveal a stereotypical tech dad vibe mixed with some humblebrags and niche industry content. The ability jokingly mocks his repetitive tech dad persona and humblebragging. The attack channels his most common behavior: niche, cryptic technical complaints or observations that confuse outsiders but get mild engagement from his circle. Given his technical focus and occasional cryptic posts, his attack type is psyop for the mildly confusing nature. He shows resistance to psyop as he thrives in that confusing niche, but is weak to roast since sharp criticism and mocking would likely deflate his image and impact. His hit points are on the lower side due to the lowbie tier and modest tweet impact.",
