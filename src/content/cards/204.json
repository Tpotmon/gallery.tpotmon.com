  "description": "Odds is a nanobie with very low followers and engagement, hence low hit points. Their main content revolves around neural networks and personal projects but with little traction and some self-deprecating commentary on the quality of their posts. The ability is a sarcastic jab at their proclaimed expertise in neural networks contrasted by their confusing and modest posts. Their signature attack mocks their very low impact promotion attempts. Given their tendency to post somewhat confusing and ironically self-defeating content, their attack type is psyop. They resist psyop attacks due to being somewhat used to confusing content but are vulnerable to roasts that highlight their social media failures and awkwardness.",
