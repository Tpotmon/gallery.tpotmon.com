  "description": "Assigned 140 HP since jaivin ðŸŽ¨ is an ultrabie tier user with nearly 10k followers and active engagement, balancing strong influence but not topmost tier. Ability 'Builder's Block' mocks their constant theme of building and creation but ironically stumbling with ambiguous vibes like 'unlocking my joy boy.' The attack 'Check That Check!' is drawn from their tweet about getting a check back, which creates a self-boost moment that is ironically underwhelming but notable for roasting their hopeful tone. Attack type is 'roast' because they are biting but positive. Weakness to 'cringe' suits the awkward, sometimes overthought personal and motivational tweets. Resistance to 'drama' fits their largely positive and relatively low-conflict tone. Despite some introspection, no clear signs of furry or other niche types were found, so roast/cringe/drama fits best here.",
