  "description": "Stoic Femboy is a nanobie tier account with low hit points reflecting their smaller but active following and tweet count. The ability mocks polite AI interactions, matching the user's ironic and dismissive tone about respectfulness and AI. The attack is based on their obsessive repetitive usage of 'Wife material' in quotes, which is cringe-worthy to many and thus fits a 'cringe' attack type. They are weak to 'roast' attacks because their posting invites criticism and sarcastic jabs. Their display name and retweet of 'kissing boys is fun' plus some positive LGBTQ+ vibes in their tweets grant them resistance to the 'gay' type. Their profile and tweets contain no furry or animal anthropomorphic content beyond a spider photo, which is insufficient to qualify for the furry type. The choice of nanobie tier and corresponding hit points and attack damage reflect their modest follower base and engagement.",
