  "description": "Based on the user's profile as a 'wizard seeking wisdom' with tweets heavy on mystical, spiritual, and conspiracy-like content mixed with frequent self-promotion, the ability mocks their earnest yet desperate approach to spiritual influence online. Their attack reflects this pattern of incessant Patreon/Discord/Telegram recruitment posts disguised as enlightened wisdom, making the attack type 'psyop' to emphasize the manipulative vibe. Their weakness is to 'roast' as sharp criticism and irony expose the pretentiousness and hollow self-importance. They resist 'psyop' type attacks well, being somewhat immune to confusion or manipulation due to their own cryptic style. Hit points and attack damage fit 'highbie' range according to the tier.",
