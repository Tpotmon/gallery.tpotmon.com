  "description": "Melkey is a megabie tier tech influencer with a high follower count and solid engagement, showing strong hits in dev communities. His ability sarcastically mocks his polished coding persona that hides behind polished tutorials and product launches. The attack is inspired by his most viral tweet where he flexes collaboration with AI and apps, an ironic jab at his tech hype culture. He resists roast attacks well since he himself indulges in roasting and sharp tech commentary, but his weakness lies in psyop tactics as his content is straightforward and sincere, thus confused easily by manipulation and misdirection. His megabie tier grants him high hit points and attack damage fitting a powerful tech persona.",
