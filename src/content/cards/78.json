  "description": "The lowbie tier user focused heavily on robotics, tech, and personal reflections expressing burnout and overwork. The ability mocks their robotic, jargon-filled posts that confuse more than clarify. The attack is based on their frequent sharing of overwhelming multitasking and tech-life struggles, embodying a psyop style to confuse and mentally overload opponents. They resist psyop attacks as they're seasoned in complex tech talk but are weak to goon types who confront aggressively, cutting through their overthinking with blunt force.",
