  "description": "The user mostly retweets and reposts popular content instead of creating original posts, showing a strong leaning towards repurposing existing internet trends, thus fitting a psyop attack type centered on manipulation and confusion. Their ability mocks this by highlighting their reliance on repeated content instead of originality. The 'Echo Chamber' attack pokes fun at the repetitive retweets hoping to gain traction without substance. Because the user hides behind recycled content, they resist other psyops but are vulnerable to roast attacks that criticize and expose their lack of originality. Due to moderate follower count and content volume, a nanobie tier with low hit points and attack damage is appropriate. There is no evidence of furry, catfish, thirst, or other specialized themes, so psyop and roast are the best fits.",
