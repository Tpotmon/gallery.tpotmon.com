  "description": "This lowbie tier user posts a high volume of controversial, aggressively opinionated tweets often about social dynamics and tech frustrations, which lends itself to the drama type for the attack. The ability mocks their grandiose self-image and world-fixing attitude with a sarcastic twist. Due to their combative tone, they are weak to roast-type attacks (sharp criticism) which can pierce their ego. They resist drama somewhat, being used to stirring conflicts. The lack of animal or furry-related content excludes that type. Their low follower count and tweet traction justify the lower HP and attack damage.",
