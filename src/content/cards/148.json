  "description": "Aj DeSwart® is a lowbie tier user with moderate hit points reflecting their small but consistent engagement. Their profile and tweets strongly signal LGBTQ+ and furry community support, including explicit trans pride and furry references, making 'furry' an ideal attack type. The ability mocks their dependence on retweets, highlighting a lack of original content. Their main attack draws on their tendency to overwhelm timelines with retweets, notably with furry and pride content, which might annoy others. They resist furry type attacks due to their community affinity but are weakened by sharp roasts that cut through their retweet shield. This balance captures their online persona accurately while introducing diversity by emphasizing 'furry' type instead of common picks like cringe or drama.",
