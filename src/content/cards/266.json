  "description": "The hit points reflect a lowbie tier user with modest follower count and engagement. The ability mocks their self-stated 'iq and audhd masking as an idiot online' persona combined with their love for cheesy content and quirks. The attack is based on their frequent sarcastic, ironic, and self-deprecating posts, often feeling awkward or cringey but with a hint of humor. 'Cheese Grater' pokes fun at their distinctive cheese obsession and their erratic but relatable tweeting style about meds and wasted time. The weakness to 'roast' comes from their openness to self-jabs and sarcasm, which can be flipped back on them effectively. The resist to 'psyop' reflects their tendency to bluntly call out nonsense and not fall easily to confusion or manipulative content. The card avoids overused types like 'drama' or 'gaslight' and opts for 'cringe' to match their quirky and awkward charm, while also highlighting the lack of serious influence or aggressive behavior.",
