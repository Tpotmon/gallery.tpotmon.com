  "description": "Kyon is an ultra-experienced tech and ML influencer with a sharp tongue and sarcastic style. His ability mocks overhyped simple tech projects, matching his profile as a defender of serious dev work. His attack is inspired by his viral tweet about a colleague's sparse commits, perfectly roasting laziness and shallow effort in tech communities. He resists psyop due to his straightforward, logic-driven posts but is weak against drama, as emotional conflicts and controversies would disrupt his calm, rational facade. The card balances his high follower count and sophisticated content with a biting sarcastic tone reflected in ability and attack. No animal or furry themes are present, so that type is excluded.",
