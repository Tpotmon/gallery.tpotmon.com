  "description": "Emo is a highbie tier user with a moderately strong presence reflected in their 110 HP and modest attack power. Their tweets blend existential musings, low-effort 'good morning/good night' posts, and self-deprecating humor, which inspired the 'Existential Glitch' ability mocking their confusing and aimless vibe. The chosen attack, 'gm if you care,' targets their passive-aggressive, slight attention-seeking posts that barely engage. 'Cringe' type fits their awkward and sometimes out-of-touch tone rather than a more aggressive or manipulative style. They resist 'psyop' attacks well because their content is more straightforward awkwardness than deliberate manipulation. However, they are weak to 'drama' since emotional conflicts and controversies would disrupt their ironically detached facade. There were no real furry or animal-themed elements in their profile or tweets despite some images, so 'furry' type was not assigned, preserving type diversity.",
