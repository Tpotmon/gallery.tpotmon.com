  "description": "The user Surfacelevel has a moderate hit point pool fitting their nanobie tier. Their ability sarcastically mocks their obsession with sourdough as a cure-all, reflecting their foodie and coach identity. Their attack references the dense theological and philosophical tweets that tend to confuse or bore readers, fitting a psyop attack type. They resist psyop due to their comfort in complex theories, but are weak to roast attacks that call out their pretentiousness. The overall design mirrors their serious, reflective posting style mixed with niche interests like baking and theology, with a sarcastic jab at their self-seriousness and niche obsessions.",
