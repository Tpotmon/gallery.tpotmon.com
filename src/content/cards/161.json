  "description": "Based on the user's self-description of not knowing what they're doing and frequent accidental or confusing posts (like deleted files and CSS jokes), the ability mocks their clueless vibe, while the attack highlights their tendency to post confusing or lost content. The user is assigned 'psyop' attack type for spreading confusing or manipulative vibes in posts. They resist psyop due to their comfort in confusion, but are weak to gaslighting, as having their reality questioned can disrupt their uncertain persona. Their low follower count and engagement put them in lowbie tier with corresponding hit points and attack damage.",
