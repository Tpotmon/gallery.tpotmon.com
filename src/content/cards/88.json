  "description": "The user is a 'nanobie' tier with low hit points reflecting modest influence and original content. Their activity is dominated by retweeting viral, often politically charged or meme-heavy content, indicating a style of amplifying rather than creating. Hence, the ability mocks their copy-paste nature with \"Serial Retweeter.\" The attack name \"Carlosfpg Copy-Paste\" directly references this behavior and sarcastically points out the lack of original commentary while still sharing viral posts. The attack type is 'psyop' because retweets include manipulative or confusing geopolitical information and memes that can mislead or saturate feeds with mixed messages.\n\nWeakness is 'roast' because direct criticism and sharp commentary can cut through the passive retweeting persona, challenging the user's echoing pattern. Resistance is also 'psyop' as the user seems comfortable in confusing or manipulative content streams, showing resilience against such mind games.\n\nNo furry or animal themes were detected in profile or media; content is primarily political and meme retweets. The pictures are mostly of the user personally or abstract banners, reinforcing no furry or queer themes. Thus, the types chosen suit the user's posting style and content topics.",
