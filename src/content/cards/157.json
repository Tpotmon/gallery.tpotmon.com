  "description": "Ethan Kael is a nanobie-tier indie developer and new dad juggling family chaos and coding dreams. The ability 'Dad Life Debug' pokes fun at his real-life multitasking woes and debugging failure outside coding. His attack 'Ethan's Code Crib' reflects his tweeting about indie game dev, AI tools, and baby chaos, combining exhaustion and overworked development into a cringe-inducing attack that fits his modest follower count and low engagement. His weakness to 'roast' suits his self-deprecating, sometimes whiny tweets about product flaws and AI frustrations, making him vulnerable to sharp criticisms. He resists 'psyop' because his content is straightforward tech and personal updates, not misleading or manipulative. His profile pictures and tweets show no furry or LGBTQ+ content, nor aggression or gaslighting. Thus, the types chosen align with his genuine, low-profile indie dev/dad persona.",
