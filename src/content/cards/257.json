  "description": "Loek is a lowbie tier user with 318 followers and 5k+ tweets, posting often about dreamy, melancholic, and quirky topics like e-children, neet aspirations, and personal musings. The profile is not aggressive or confrontational but rather self-deprecating and whimsical, fitting a gaslight attack type because his tweets often make others question normalcy or reality. The ability pokes fun at his self-professed 'software bricklayer' role mixed with his dreamy personality. The attack reflects his lovelorn, nerdy tweeting style that can confuse foes with sincerity overload. He is weak to roast type attacks, which cut through his dreamy fog with harsh critique and irony. He resists psyop types as his posts don't fall for or spread manipulative or misleading content easily. There's no animal-themed content, so furry is avoided. Overall, this card encapsulates his quirky, gentle, and somewhat clueless online persona with mild power appropriate for a lowbie.",
