  "description": "This user is a lowbie tier with modest hit points reflecting limited influence. The ability mocks their self-proclaimed status and verbose posts full of complex knowledge no one really understands, fitting a sarcastic jab at their over-inflated ego and content style. The attack is psyop because the tweets often involve confusing, obscure algorithmic and mystical concepts that can bewilder followers. Resistance to psyop type matches their comfort in confusing others but weakness to roast suits their vulnerability to sharp criticism due to their intellectual posturing. No animal or furry content was found, so furry type was not applied. Overall, the card reflects the user's theme of cryptic knowledge and ironic self-importance with sarcasm.",
