  "description": "The user is a 'nanobie' with low follower count but many quirky and sarcastic posts often involving awkward sexual humor and self-deprecating tech jokes, leading to a low HP of 35. The ability mocks their 'tech likes me, a wee bit deranged' self-description by portraying their attempts at social debugging as more confusing than helpful. The attack draws from their frequent boner jokes and awkward flirtation, which typically induce secondhand embarrassment, fitting the cringe type. They are weak to roast-type attacks since sharp criticism hits where it hurts their awkward persona, but resistant to psyop types because their own posts often embrace confusion and sarcasm, making them less vulnerable to manipulation.",
