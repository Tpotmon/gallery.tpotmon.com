  "description": "Since Nor 遊子's profile declares they're 'Lost so I Wander' and focuses on art with no tweets to analyze, the ability mocks their aimless wandering theme ironically. The attack riffs on their rambling, directionless art content that likely confuses followers, fitting the psyop type as it misleads about depth. Weakness to cringe fits because awkward or out-of-touch content can undermine their vague art vibe. Resistance to psyop is logical as their style already embraces confusion, making them less sensitive to it.",
