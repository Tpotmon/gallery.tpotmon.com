  "description": "With a highbie tier and an uncommon rarity, hitPoints are set mid to high with 110. The ability mocks the user's constant posting of knights and demons art that may overwhelm or confuse followers, ironically branding their creativity as a nightmare filter. The attack focuses on their frequent morning greeting tweets paired with AI art, an obvious repetitive behavior that might annoy their audience, hence a psyop type for the confusing and manipulative timeline clutter. Weakness to roast is natural, as sharp criticism could pierce their careful artful persona, while resistance to psyop fits their familiarity with confusion and mystique in their content. No furry or LGBTQ+ elements found, despite some animal art, it's minimal and not a defining theme, so it's excluded to maintain type accuracy.",
