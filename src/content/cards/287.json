  "description": "The card’s hitpoints are set moderately high (95) for a highbie tier to reflect Ian's steady progress and decent engagement. \"Muscle Memory Malfunction\" ironically jabs at his repeated muscle tests and frequent leaks, a sarcastic nod to his ongoing struggles despite his engineering attempts. The attack \"Anthro-Not-So-Bio\" mocks his bio-inspired 'muscle' projects that leak or fail, linking directly to his behavior of posting about artificial muscle tests — it's a furry type due to his anthro and humanoid bioengineering theme visible in profile and tweets. Weakness to 'roast' aligns with his openness to critique from a technical crowd who might tear down engineering fails, while resistance to 'cringe' reflects his generally professional and technical tone that avoids embarrassing posts. Overall, the card captures Ian’s bio-robotics passion with a teasing tone highlighting his persistent troubleshooting and anthro focus.",
