  "description": "Hit points are lowbie range, reflecting a modest follower base and limited engagement. Ability mocks the user's 'professional sniper' claim, highlighting their consistent crypto hype misses. The attack is named after their repeated emphasis on the #memeboat meme campaign, which despite some activity, comes off as awkward and cringe-worthy. Attack type chosen as 'cringe' to reflect their awkward hype posts and meme obsession. Weakness against 'roast' fits due to their vulnerability to sharp criticism given their over-the-top promotional style and lack of solid traction. They resist 'thirst' slightly since their content is not flirtatious or suggestive. No furry content detected despite some animal images, so 'cringe' and 'roast' better fit their posting behavior and persona.",
