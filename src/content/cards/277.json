  "description": "Given the user's nanobie tier and moderate engagement, hit points are modest at 35. The ability mocks their repetitive 'be unique' messages that paradoxically mute real discourse. Their attack derives from frequent 'GM' posts and generic motivational quotes that come off as cringe-worthy. Attack type is 'cringe' to match their awkward, overposted motivational style. Weakness is 'roast' as sharp criticism would puncture their vapid positivity. Resistance is 'drama' since the user avoids controversies and maintains a calm, peaceful stance. No furry or other niche content is present to alter type selection.",
