  "description": "Given datboi (DBC)'s profile as a career technologist flaunting his wealth and success, the ability mocks his constant humblebrags and business-speak. The attack pulls from his repetitive vacation posts and bragging about wealth, serving a roast-type attack. His posts show little conflict but a desire for accountability and realness, making drama an effective weakness. Resistant to roast attacks because he already thrives on personal sharp commentary and criticism. The tier is nanobie, so low-medium stats are fitting.",
