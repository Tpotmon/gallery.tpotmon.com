  "description": "Given Cisco's self-described sweet and charming persona contrasted with ironically unhinged, awkward, and oft-repeated goofy catchphrases, his ability mocks how his charm can confuse rather than help. His primary attack mocks his fixation on the 'goofy goobers' phrase that appears all over his timeline, a cringe-worthy yet signature move. His high engagement and follower count place him in the highbie tier, giving him moderate HP and attack damage. Cisco's weakness to sharp criticism (roast) fits his persona vulnerable to insults, while he resists cringe attacks due to his comfort in awkward territory. There's no animal or furry content in profile or tweets, so furry type is not assigned despite some playful energy. The attack type is cringe, reflecting his awkward repetitive posting style, and the weakness type roast targets criticism that would break his charm mask.",
