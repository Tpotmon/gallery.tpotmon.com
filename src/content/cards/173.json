  "description": "The user is a nanobie level investor with a small but verified following who obsessively posts about his 'Golden Glock' awards, which are clearly empty hype to maintain relevance. The ability sarcastically references this hollow award scheme. The attack roasts this spamming of low-engagement, forced awards, highlighting the lack of genuine traction. Weakness is to cringe because the account's forced bravado and overhyped posts verge on embarrassing in their desperation, making awkwardness and exposure a real counter. Resistance is to roast since the user embraces the biting commentary style and even creates 'awards' possibly rewarding drama or trolling. No furry or LGBTQ+ content present. The user posts aggressive hype but no real bullying or gaslighting; hence roast fits best. Hit points and attack damage are low due to nanobie tier and low follower engagement.",
