  "description": "Kiri is a megabie tier AI dev and community leader heavily focused on retweeting AI and tech content rather than original posts, often creating a confusing info-barrage (hence the psyop attack and resistance). Their profile and tweets show a strong inclination toward hyped tech jargon and community growth, inspiring an ability that ironically confuses more than clarifies. The attack is named 'Kiri's Retweet Barrage' to jab at their heavy reliance on retweets over original ideas. Their weakness to roast type aligns with how sharp criticism and sarcastic commentary can cut through their hype and illusions. The resistance to psyop type reflects their comfort within the confusing and manipulative tech-talk space. No furry or queer content was observed to assign those types.",
