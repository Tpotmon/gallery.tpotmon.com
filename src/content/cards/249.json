  "description": "The user has a 'highbie' tier, granting them moderate to high HP (110). Their profile shows a former SWE and finance analyst who posts sarcastic, tech-savvy content laced with irony. The ability mocks their tendency to sound smart but be confusing with jargon. Their attack reflects their sarcastic, sharp commentary on tech and finance topics with a roasting style. They have many retweets of critical posts and sarcastic quotes, fitting a 'roast' attack type. They resist criticism well due to their sharp tone but are vulnerable to psyops because their sarcasm can be derailed by confusing or manipulative content. No furry or LGBTQ+ content is present in profile or tweets, so those types aren't assigned.",
