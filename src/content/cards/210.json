  "description": "With an ultrabie tier and 4192 followers, retrodev⌨ has a decent presence, primarily focused on programming, motivation, and positivity – all delivered with a strong dose of earnestness that borders on awkward. Their content often features coding jokes, personal development mantras, and snapshots of tech hobbies, which suits a 'cringe' attack type as their posts sometimes come across as painfully earnest or awkward. The ability sarcastically jabs at their relentless positivity which sometimes seems more naive than inspiring. The weakness to 'roast' is because sharp criticism could puncture the upbeat facade, while they resist 'cringe' due to their comfort in that realm. The ultrabie hit points and relatively strong attack damage reflect their solid following and active engagement. No furry or other special types found in their content or images.",
