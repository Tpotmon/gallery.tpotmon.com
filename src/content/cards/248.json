  "description": "With a 'megabie' tier and over 11k followers, taoki earns high hit points reflecting their strong presence. Their profile picture as a sloth and self-description inspired the ironically named ability 'Sloth Mode Activated', mocking their lazy internet persona. Taoki's tweets feature a stream of provocative, often offensive hot takes and controversial statements, leading to the roast-type attack 'Taoki's Hot Takes' which aggressively targets others with biting, unoriginal commentary. Due to their frequent provocative and blunt insults, they resist roast attacks well but are vulnerable to gaslighting as their reality can be challenged and contradicted. While frequent outrage and strong opinions suggest drama potential, the main character of their content is sharp ridicule and roasting. No furry or LGBTQ+ elements are present despite animal profile imagery, so roast and gaslight types were chosen for balance and accuracy.",
