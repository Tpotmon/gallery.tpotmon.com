  "description": "Itami is a lowbie tier user with moderate tweets and niche niche personal content, focused on family, some humor, and occasional gaming/spiritual themes. His profile and posts lack aggressive or bullying behavior but show a penchant for confusing, indirect, and somewhat ironic statements, so his attack is a psyop type reflecting his power outage tweets and odd humor. He resists psyop due to familiarity but is weak to goon types who confront directly since he prefers indirect sarcasm. The ability mocks his grandiose description of reaching the stars contrasted with mundane, quirky life moments. The hitPoints are modest for lowbie range at 35, with attack damage moderate for his tier and interaction level. No furry type because animal references are minor and not central to content.",
