  "description": "Jasper is a lowbie tier streamer tweeting mostly about video game speedruns and streaming schedules with low engagement. Their ability mocks their slow streaming style and confused niche memes. The attack 'Sigma Ikari Smackdown' references their 'Sigma Ikari' tweet that got few likes but some replies, showing their content baffles most. Given their niche gaming content and low follower base, their attack damage is modest. Psyop is chosen as the attack type because their posts are sometimes confusing or niche references that don't land broadly. Their resistance is also to psyop as they seem comfortable in confusing content. Their weakness is cringe, as awkward or embarrassing moments could disrupt their persona. No furry content detected despite the narwhal profile image. Hit points are low end of lowbie tier due to modest follower count and engagement.",
