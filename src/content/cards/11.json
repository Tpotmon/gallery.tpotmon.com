  "description": "SELO is an ultrabie tier developer and data enthusiast with a focus on X-graphs, building complex visualizations and infrastructure. Their ability mocks their obsession with compiling and analyzing huge amounts of data, humorously highlighting how they get lost in their own work. Their attack reflects their signature behavior of overwhelming others with massive data dumps and complicated charts, a perfect psyop type attack. Due to their analytical nature and tech background, they resist psyop attacks but are weak to direct, aggressive confrontations (goon). This matches their techy, somewhat introverted persona who prefers data over conflict. No furry or LGBTQ+ content was present, so those types are not assigned. Their hit points and attack damage fit ultrabie ranges based on their influence and activity.",
