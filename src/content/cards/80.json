  "description": "Based on Momma Occo's profile as a VTuber drama commentator and anti-bully host, their ability 'Drama Magnet' sarcastically reflects their constant pull into internet conflicts and gossip. Their signature attack 'Occo's Spilled Tea' is a blunt jab at their penchant for stirring drama and delivering hot takes with a clown emoji flair. They are ultrabie tier, granting them 140 hit points and a strong attack damage of 75. Their weakness to 'roast' aligns with how sharp criticism would wound their drama-centric persona, while they resist drama itself, embodying a veteran in internet tea circles. No furry type was assigned as their content and imagery do not indicate animal or anthro themes despite the octopus emoji in their name and profile.",
