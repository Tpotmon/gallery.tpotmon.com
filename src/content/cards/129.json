  "description": "compuficial is a highbie-tier tech-savvy user focusing on AI, integrations, and software, evident by their technical, thoughtful tweets on distributed systems and AI. Their profile and tweets evoke a highly rational, somewhat aloof persona that thrives on complex ideas and self-hosting tech setups. The sarcastic ability 'Engineer’s Paradox' mocks their efficiency-focused mindset that ironically fails in social warmth. The attack 'Code of Silence' reflects their tendency to confuse and isolate others with technical discourse rather than engage warmly — hence 'psyop' type suits their manipulative, confusing style. Their weakness to 'roast' attacks fits because sharp criticism would break through their intellectual facade. Resistance to 'psyop' matches their comfort in complex, confusing environments. No evident animal or furry themes exist, so 'furry' type is not chosen. The HP and attack damage are set in the mid-range reflecting a highbie tier with moderate influence and posting engagement.",
