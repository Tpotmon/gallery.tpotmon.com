  "description": "Given the user's megabie tier and massive follower base, along with a strong technical and cryptography-focused content, high hit points and attack damage are justified. The ability 'Terminal Overlord' sarcastically nods to their insistence on staying in the terminal forever as if it grants invincibility. The attack, 'Snowcrash Syntax Slam,' jabs at their heavy use of complex programming references that alienate most, creating a confusing psyop-style attack. They resist psyop attacks due to their mastery of complex knowledge but are weak to 'roast' attacks since their intense technical pride makes them vulnerable to sharp criticism. No furry or LGBTQ+ content or drama were evident; the user is a high-tier cryptography and coding influencer, so psyop and roast types fit best.",
