  "description": "verrsane is a high-tier tech influencer with deep AI/ML knowledge and a sharp, sarcastic tone. His ability mocks his obsessive chase for clout and trendy tech themes, highlighting his ironic disconnect from real emotions. His attack centers on his frequent roasts of the shallow 'vibe coding' culture and tech trends, which reflects his tweeting style of sharp, biting commentary. He's resistant to other roasts due to his own biting sarcasm but vulnerable to drama types since controversy and emotional conflicts easily disrupt his cold, calculated persona.",
