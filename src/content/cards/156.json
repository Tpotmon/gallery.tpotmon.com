  "description": "Volty codes with a highbie energy, so his hit points and attack damage reflect decent presence but not top-tier dominance. The ability sarcastically plays on his enthusiastic but chaotic coding and social vibe. The attack mocks his famously viral 'I fucked up at my internship' tweet, which got overwhelmingly huge traction due to the cringe-worthy self-roast tone and massive engagement. He's weak to sharp criticism ('roast') because he openly exposes vulnerability and self-deprecating humor. Resistant to 'psyop' (mind games) since he frequently shares candid, straightforward thoughts and rants rather than manipulative or confusing content. His profile and tweets lack any animal/furry themes, so that type is not assigned here.",
