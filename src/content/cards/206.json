  "description": "The user, 'Storm', is a nanobie-tier functional programmer and startup founder who heavily references functional programming and Effect TS in their tweets, often sharing nerdy and overly technical content that mostly gets ignored or only appreciated by niche peers. Their ability mocks how their references to Effect TS and programming make their presence painfully niche and boring to general followers. Their attack focuses on their typical behavior of dropping dense functional programming terms that repel average conversations, making it a cringe type. Given their technical depth and AI enthusiasm, they are more resistant to confusing psyop type content but weak to direct sharp criticisms or 'roast'. The modest hit points and attack damage reflect their low-tier but specialized presence on Twitter.",
