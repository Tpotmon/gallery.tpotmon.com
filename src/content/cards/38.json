  "description": "The hit points are on the lower side due to being a lowbie tier. The ability takes a sarcastic jab at the user's frequent bug and service frustrations seen in tweets criticizing Snapchat, Cursor AI, and platform outages. The attack reflects their persistent griping on tech failures and poor support, typical cringe content with little engagement but noticeable persistence. The user is weak to roast type because sharp criticism would hurt their fragile ego, while they're somewhat resistant to cringe, as they're well accustomed to being awkward and self-deprecating. The overall card captures the user's vibe as a grumpy, technically savvy complainer with modest reach and a tendency to dwell on issues more than solutions.",
