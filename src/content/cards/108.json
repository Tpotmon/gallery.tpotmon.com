  "description": "This lowbie tier user with moderate followers and decent activity has hit points in the lower mid-range. Their content is a mix of digital aesthetics, accelerationist vibes, and somewhat cryptic or philosophical tweets, often reflecting confusion or indecision. \n\nThe ability 'Vibe Acceleration' sarcastically mocks their self-assigned amateur aesthetic vibe and accelerationist talk, implying it only accelerates confusion. The attack is themed around their popular tweet asking for unbiased opinions on logo design, which got the most engagement yet lacks real focus â€” hence a psyop attack that confuses opponents. \n\nThey resist psyop attacks due to their own propensity for cryptic, confusing content but are vulnerable to roast attacks that cut through their fog of vague digital posturing. No animal or furry-related content appeared, so that type was not assigned. The overall card reflects their thoughtful yet scattered digital boy persona and low-tier card power.",
