  "abilityDescription": "Suffers existential dread from living on Mars while obsessively rageposting about humanity's downfall. Automatically triggers a wave of self-pitying gloom that ironically makes opponents question why they even engage.",
  "attackName": "Vittorio's Virtue Signal",
  "attackDescription": "Unleashes a brutally sincere rant on social decay, fitness elitism, and societal collapse — as if yelling into the void will fix anything.",

  "description": "This high-tier megabie user has a massive follower count and heavy tweet volume filled with aggressive social commentary, bleak observations, and a heavy dose of personal bitterness — perfect for a drama-type attack. The ability riffs on their Martian location and constant existential rage, with a sarcastic jab at their self-seriousness. They resist psyops well as their tweets show clear strong opinions and conspiracy bursts but are weak to roast attacks since their defensive coping mechanisms seem thin under sharp criticism, as seen in their own biting insults toward others. The attack damage is high given their large following and viral tweets. No furry or LGBTQ+ related content was found, so those types were not selected. The profile picture and banner do not depict any animal or anthro themes either. Overall, 'Vittorio' epitomizes the dramatic, high-energy, critical, and gloomy online persona.",
