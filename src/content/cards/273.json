  "description": "Wade is a technical highbie who runs a music remastering service and posts heavily about AI, coding, and obscure tech concepts, reflecting a cerebral and somewhat niche persona. His ability mocks how he remasters or repackages complicated topics, ironically making things more confusing rather than clearer. His primary attack, 'Wade's Wall of Words,' riffs on his penchant for long, jargon-heavy tweets that repel readers rather than attract them, fitting the psyop type since his content is confusing or manipulative in its complexity. He resists psyop attacks because he's used to navigating complex, confusing topics, but is weak to roasts since sharp criticism or humor about his obscure or pretentious style likely hits hard. There are no animal or furry themes in his content or images, so furry type is not applied. The hitPoints and attackDamage reflect his highbie tier, moderate but not ultra-powerful.",
