  "description": "Dot is an AI grad student tweeting heavily about coding, AI, and productivity tensions, with a sarcastic, self-deprecating style. Their ability riffs on their ironic overreliance on AI despite stress and deadliness of deadlines. The attack mocks their repeated slow-dev roasts and personal complaints about productivity. Dot resists psyop attacks given their tech-savvy mindset but is weak to drama since they engage and provoke emotional conversations and conflicts often. The highbie tier setting guides the moderate hitpoints and attack damage. No furry content was found despite animal pictures; the type assigned is roast to match their sharp criticisms and sarcastic tone.",
