  "description": "Burnzzz is a 'lowbie' tier user with modest follower engagement, mostly posting stock-related charts, memes, and vague motivational content under the guise of 'vibes'. The ability mocks their attempt to hijack AI as a matrix escape, ironically highlighting their lack of unique insight. Their attack targets the persistent nagging for more posts, reflecting their tweet history full of self-referential 'post more' comments and low-energy content that tries to manipulate engagement (psyop). They resist confusion-based tactics due to their constant barrage of repeated messages but are weak to sharp criticism (roast) that cuts through their nebulous persona and forced vibes. The hit points are on the lower end fitting their lowbie tier. No furry or other specialized types apply due to lack of animal-themed content.",
