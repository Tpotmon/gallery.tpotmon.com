  "description": "Francois Botha's card draws heavily from his tech-savvy yet skeptical persona who blends politics, humor, and social commentary often via retweets rather than original postingâ€”earning a lowbie tier with modest HP. The ability mocks his self-styled insightful skepticism that mostly retreads popular or meme content. His attack highlights his signature behavior of amplifying others' pointed takes that mix tech and political themes, often confusing or half-baked, hence 'psyop' as attack type. Given his reliance on skepticism and irony, he resists similar confusing manipulations but is vulnerable to gaslighting challenges that question his perceived reality or logic. No furry or LGBTQ themes are present, and the tone is humorously critical, matching his style and content footprint.",
