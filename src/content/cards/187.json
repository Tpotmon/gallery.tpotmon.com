  "description": "The user is a lowbie tier programmer tweeting about build systems and coding frustrations, mostly with humorous sarcasm. Ability mocks their automatic retrying of failed builds and refusal to 'quit'. Attack targets their frequent complaints about qmake build system, which creates drama around technical issues. They resist cringe-type attacks due to their technical savvy but are weak to roast attacks that focus on their sarcasm and complaining style.",
