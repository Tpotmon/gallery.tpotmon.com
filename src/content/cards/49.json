  "description": "light magician is a nanobie tier user focused on AI, systems, and security with a strong leaning on technical retweets and complex memetic commentary. Their ability mocks their tendency to confuse with jargon. The attack is based on their top liked retweet advising to learn React to get a job, highlighting their tendency to share oversimplified or ironic tech advice, making it a psyop type. They are weak to 'goon' types because direct aggressive confrontation would break their obscure tech veil, but resistant to 'psyop' because they thrive on mind games and confusing info. Their low hit points reflect their newness and modest follower base.",
