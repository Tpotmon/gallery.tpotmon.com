  "description": "Sacrificial Pancakes is an ultrabie tier user with a high follower count and heavy engagement mainly through retweets and tech or AI related musings. Their profile and tweets show a dense, data-driven persona mixed with cryptic, esoteric humor. The ability 'Cognitive Overload' pokes fun at their complex, jargon-filled digital identity and the occasional increase in latency or token burn they mention. 'Retweet Roast' attack is inspired by their frequent retweets of spicy, viral content as well as their own dry, snarky remarks — an ironic nod to their style of posting that bombards followers with dense content. Due to their technical, logic-heavy behavior, they are weak to 'psyop' tactics that confuse or disrupt their mental framework, while being resistant to 'cringe' type because their style is too cerebral and ironic to be embarrassed easily. There is no evident furry content in profile picture or tweets, so that type was not assigned.",
