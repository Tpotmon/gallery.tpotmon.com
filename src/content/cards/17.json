  "description": "Given asuran's highbie tier, hit points are moderately high (95). The ability mocks his polymath persona but ironically highlights that he lacks precise focus, mirroring his retweet-heavy activity. The attack leverages his addiction to retweeting notable posts, which drowns his own voice and becomes a confusing psyop to followers. His content heavily leans on retweeting and amplifying others, matching the 'psyop' type. The largest weakness is 'gaslight' since questioning his reality or original contributions would unnerve the scattered retweet persona. He has resistance to other psyop attacks because his account already deals with mixed signals and complex discourse, making confusion less effective. There is no furry content, LGBTQ+ themes, or thirst/flirtatious behavior, so those types were excluded. The cover and profile pictures show a serious, unanimated face with no animal themes, reinforcing no furry assignment.",
