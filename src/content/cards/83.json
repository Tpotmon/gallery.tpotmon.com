  "description": "The card is nanobie tier, so hit points are minimal. The ability mocks her constant procrastination and excuses about productivity, which are a notable theme. The attack comes from a specific tweet about destroying her boyfriend's YouTube algorithm, reflecting her quirky yet counterproductive behavior. The attack type is 'cringe' due to awkward and out-of-touch posting style, fitting her social media tone. She resists cringe as she thrives in it and is weak to goon, as direct confrontations could disrupt her delicate digital lifestyle.",
