  "description": "Given the user's high engagement in confusing, contradictory, and ironic posts (e.g., 'I like posts without understanding them' and 'hashtag all insane posts are sincere'), they fit a 'psyop' attack type which centers on confusing and manipulative content. The ability mocks their clueless confidence and ironic posting tone. The attack capitalizes on their frequently confusing tweets that puzzle readers. They resist psyop attacks themselves because they thrive in confusion but are weak to 'roast' type attacks because sharp criticism and biting commentary expose their flawed logic and sarcasm. The hitPoints are in the ultrabie range (100-150) aligned with their highbie tier and substantial follower count. Despite no clear furry or LGBTQ+ content, the highlight of contradictory and manipulative content steers toward psyop, not other types. The sarcastic ability and attack names reflect Bozo's ironic and chaotic Twitter persona.",
