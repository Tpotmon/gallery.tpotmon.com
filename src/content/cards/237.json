  "description": "Loftwah's profile and tweets revolve heavily around technology curiosity, nostalgia for old tech days, and a generally laid-back but somewhat confusing tech commentary style. Their high follower count and verification place them in the ultrabie tier with 130 HP. The ability mocks their tendency to flood timelines with tech rants that require mental reboot (Ctrl+Alt+Delete pun). The attack leans into their slow, confusing tech logic and nostalgic rambling that might frustrate others, making the attack type 'psyop' fitting. Their weakness is sharp criticism or roasts that cut through their sometimes scattered tech mumblings. They resist 'psyop' mildly as they are used to confusing tech babble and can resist lesser confusion attempts.",
