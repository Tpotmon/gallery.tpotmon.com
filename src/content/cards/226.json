  "description": "Ronin's card reflects his megabie tier with high hit points. His ability mocks his contradictory behavior: being a quiet, cryptic engineer who ironically whines about private RTs and viral moments. The attack is based on his most viral tweet featuring a cryptic tech image that confuses and bewilders, fitting the 'psyop' type. He resists 'psyop' attacks well due to his own cryptic and confusing content but is weak to 'roast' attacks that call out his irony and pretentiousness, as his tweets are perfect targets for sharp, biting commentary. The choice avoids generic or low-impact types and respects the user's tech-focused identity and tweeting style.",
