  "description": "Kalyan is an early-stage intern with a modest following and mostly low-engagement posts focused on personal struggles and tech projects. Their vibe is quietly awkward and earnest, reflected in their ability to 'disappear until needed,' a sarcastic nod to low visibility and action. The attack is based on their persistent but unimpressive engagement, poking fun at their cryptic, low-impact tweets. Weakness to roast fits because sharp criticism would counter their cringe-inducing attempts at depth; resistance to cringe type given their comfort zone in this awkward niche. Their hit points are minimal due to the nanobie tier and low social footprint.",
