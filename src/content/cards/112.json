  "description": "This user wants to be a robot and often posts tech-related musings and confusing AI references, so the ability ironically mocks their robotic aspirations and reliance on AI. Their attack is a low-impact 'Sigh Swipe' reflecting their often lukewarm and niche posts that donâ€™t land strongly but linger as confusing noise, thus a psyop type fits. They are weak to 'roast' because sharp criticism would pierce through their vague attempts at tech-savviness and pretentiousness. They resist psyop attacks because they already thrive in confusing or manipulative content spaces. Their lowbie tier and modest follower base warrant a low hit point and damage range.",
