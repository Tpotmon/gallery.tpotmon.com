  "description": "The user is a self-proclaimed 'vibe hacker' and indie game engine builder, constantly iterating and vocal about complex coding struggles framed as 'vibe coding.' Their tweets show deep involvement in coding with occasional grandiose claims and frustration with existing tools. The ability mocks their ironic claim of 'full control' while still wrestling with basics. The attack is based on their reversion to simplistic cubes after purging complicated rendering layers, symbolizing their chaotic coding style, hence a psyop attack. They are weak to roast type because sharp criticism would hit their pretentious vibe-hacker persona. Resistant to psyop since they themselves engage in mind games and complex AI prompt tactics. Lowbie tier dictates lower hitpoints and moderate attack damage.",
