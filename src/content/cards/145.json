  "description": "Karan is a highbie tier software builder with a polished but niche audience. His ability mocks his annoying insistence on delaying monetization and beta hype, ironically damaging trust he aims to build. His attack nails his stereotypical dev grind posts filled with burnout and technical frustrations, a boring roast of his over-shared hustle narrative. He resists psyop types due to clear, straightforward sharing but is weak to drama as emotional conflicts and controversies could rattle his calm facade. The absence of animal or furry themes means no furry assignment. Overall, his card channels his earnest developer influencer persona with a sarcastic tone and mid-level power.",
