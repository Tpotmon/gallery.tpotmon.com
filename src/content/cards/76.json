  "description": "Qwacko is a lowbie tier with relatively low hit points reflecting their small but active presence. The ability mocks their ongoing fight with the 'service grid' trying to silence them, highlighting their persistence in posting (sarcastic antimemetic diary). The attack focuses on their repetitive and somewhat annoying tweets about limited service and network fights, which come off as cringe-worthy spam. Since Qwacko seems to avoid confrontation but can be overwhelmed by direct aggressive pushback, their weakness is goon type. They resist cringe attacks slightly due to their own cringe-heavy content. There is no furry content despite animal images, as those are mostly pigeons and nature photos without furry community engagement.",
