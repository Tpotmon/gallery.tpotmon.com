  "description": "Parth is an ultrabie with solid HP reflecting his rare and verified status. His ability mocks his constant self-labeling as 'god's chosen autistic'â€”a sarcastic jab at his overconfident persona. His main attack revolves around his obsession with the blue tick and validation, mirrored in tweets like 'feeling naked without blue tick' and multiple posts about removing or flaunting theðŸ¥Š emoji. Drama fits his behavior as he stirs personal posts filled with emotional and attention-seeking content. He resists drama due to his thick skin in emotional conflicts but is weak to roast attacks that cut through his fragile ego. There's no animal/furry content, so the furry type is avoided. Overall, the card captures his mix of self-importance, frequent emotional posting, and blue tick fixation with a biting tone.",
