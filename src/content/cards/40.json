  "description": "Hit points are low due to lowbie tier with modest followers and engagement. Ability mocks DJ's constant struggle with impulse control and ironic tweeting habits. Attack highlights his repeated, embarrassing pleas for focus help while spamming tweets, making it a cringe attack. Weakness to roast fits his self-deprecating and awkward style, vulnerable to sharp criticism. Resistant to cringe since he is used to embarrassing moments and awkwardness. No furry or other niche types detected. The sarcastic tone matches DJ's humorous and self-aware profile.",
