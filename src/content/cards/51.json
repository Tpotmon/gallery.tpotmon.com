  "description": "Hayden is a verified tech influencer and prolific tweeter with over 11K tweets and 6K followers, fitting the ultrabie tier with high HP. His content revolves around tech opinions, AI fatigue, and app enthusiasm, often repeating outdated takes or ironic praise, supporting a 'psyop' attack type that confuses others with mix-matched opinions. His ability mocks his reliance on stale tech references and cached humor. His highest engagement tweets often retweet or sarcastically praise trivial tech subjects. He is weak to 'roast' types because sharp criticism exposes his overused opinions and tired humor, but resists 'psyop' since he's used to confusing or contradictory messaging. No furry or LGBTQ+ content was found, so those types were not assigned. His profile and tweets show no aggressive, dramatic, or flirtatious behavior, thus 'psyop' and 'roast' suit best.",
