  "description": "Given tunaüç£ is a megabie with a very high follower count and prolific posting about AI development, tech, and personal life, the card's hitPoints are maxed towards the top of the megabie range (180). Their ability mocks the obsessive self-retweeting and AI obsession evident in their tweets, using ironic sarcasm. The attack is based on their frequent retweets of viral memes and emojis (like the 'yacine shipped a gun emoji' tweet with 544 likes), designed as a psyop attack since the user thrives on confusing and viral AI/tech content and memetic references. Tunaüç£ is resistant to psyop due to their tech savvy but weak to roast because sharp criticism and honest calls-out would hurt their image heavily. No furry or LGBTQ+ content is present, so those types were not assigned. The profile pictures and tweets show a grounded but ironically self-aggrandizing vibe, fitting with these types and attack styles.",
