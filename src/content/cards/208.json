  "description": "Given kache's megabie tier and massive following, the card is assigned high hit points (180). The ability mocks the user's ironic self-deprecation and chaotic meme-driven persona. The main attack references kache's viral tweets about being fired and life struggles that get huge traction, emphasizing drama. The user shows resilience to drama (since their content thrives on it) but is vulnerable to psyop-type mind games since their mixture of memes and personal disclosure leaves mind-games and confusing content as their Achilles' heel. No furry or animal-themed content was found, so furry type was excluded despite profile images and memes being very tech-centric and meme-heavy. The attack damage is high as kache's posts frequently go viral and gather massive engagements.",
