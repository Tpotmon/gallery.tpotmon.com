  "description": "Exo is a highbie with decent follower count and verified status but struggles with monetization, reflecting a psyop type as they post confusing, somewhat contradictory content about stats, earnings, and platform trust issues. Their ability mocks their irony of having stats but zero earnings. Their attack is inspired by repeated posts lamenting monetization confusion, showing a psyop attack type. Their weakness is roast since sharp criticism or sarcasm would likely hit their insecurity about their platform issues. They resist psyop attacks moderately due to their apparent familiarity with confusing platform dynamics. There is no furry content despite posting an image of a 'sweet boy' (dog), so furry type is not assigned. Overall, the card aggregates their persona into a witty ironic package.",
