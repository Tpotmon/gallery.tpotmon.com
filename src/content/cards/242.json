  "description": "Noah is an ultrabie tier rare card because he is a verified, well-followed developer and product person heavily focused on AI, crypto, and generative media niche topics. His ability sarcastically mocks his constant tech bragging and insider talk, implying most people won't get his references. His attack is based on how his tweet history is full of highly specialized, jargon-filled posts that alienate the average reader, making it a strong psyop attack to confuse and overwhelm. His resistance to psyop comes from his comfort in complex, confusing tech talk. However, he's weak to cringe because exposing his awkward over-the-top tech obsession and self-promotion can destabilize his persona. There's no furry or animal-themed content despite some media showing sheep or dogs on others' tweets; his profile pictures and banners are professional and tech-focused, so no furry type assigned. The card reflects his identity as a niche crypto/AI tech bro with an ironic, sarcastic tone.",
