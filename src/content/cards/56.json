  "description": "King Stanky's highbie tier and steady follower base give him solid HP but not top-tier. His ability mocks his self-proclaimed 'professional retard' persona and aura overload, ironically highlighting his chaotic online 'energy.' The signature attack is drawn from his incessant 'wife material' meme quoting, a cringe-worthy tactic that overwhelms but lacks subtlety. His weakness to 'roast' fits his vulnerability to sharp criticism, while his resistance to 'cringe' acknowledges his seasoned tolerance of awkward, repetitive content. No furry or other niche types apply since his content is mostly sarcastic memes and personal commentary, with no animal or queer themes.",
