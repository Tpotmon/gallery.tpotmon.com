  "description": "The card's highbie tier grants it solid hit points reflecting a decent follower base and active posting. The ability pokes fun at their self-centered author claim and their apparent disorganization and procrastination. The attack is crafted from their standout tweet boasting a new job and follower engagement, highlighting their desperate self-promotion. Psyop is their weakness since they post confusing, tech-heavy posts that could be undermined by manipulation or misinformation. They resist cringe because their style is somewhat blunt and direct, showing little embarrassment even when awkward, so awkward or embarrassing content affects them less.",
