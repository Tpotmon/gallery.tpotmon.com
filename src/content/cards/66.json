  "description": "Waozi is a highbie tier with moderate hitpoints reflecting an active but niche tech developer profile. Their ability sarcastically highlights their tendency to overhype their own Kryon project with confusing and unimpactful updates, matching the psyop attack type since their tweets are often cryptic and bewildering. The attack mocks their typical content of technical jargon and vague promises. They resist other psyop attacks because they're already confusing, but are vulnerable to sharp roasting that can dismantle their pretentious tech posturing. No furry content is present despite some animal references, so furry type is not applicable here.",
