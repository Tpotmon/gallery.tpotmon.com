  "description": "Yonatan is a nanobie-tier Unity enthusiast and developer who loves announcing new releases and sharing technical insights with modest engagement. His ability pokes fun at how his detailed Unity talk often bores others (like a bug). His main attack riffs on his repetitive Grok 3 hype tweets that gain minimal traction but clearly excite him. Weakness to cringe comes from his awkward self-promotion and overenthusiasm that might embarrass him. Resistant to psyop because he spreads somewhat technical but straightforward info rather than misleading or manipulative content. His lack of drama, goon, or furry content and modest follower count place him solidly in a modest tier with moderate HP and attack damage.",
