  "description": "Milo is a nanobie tier comp-sci student obsessed with projects involving Zig, Rust, and WGPU, yet their tweets reveal a lot of frustration, incomplete progress, and ultimately cringe-worthy moments struggling with bindings and configs. Hence, they get a low hit point count (20). Their ability sarcastically mocks their preaching of documentation while forgetting to apply it. The attack focuses on their WGPU struggles, a recurring theme, which is embarrassing and cringe. They resist cringe (since their vibe matches it) but have a weakness to roast since sharp criticism can rattle their overly earnest and awkward coding attitude. No animal or furry content appears, so no furry type is assigned. The overall card reflects their struggles, frustration, and awkward online presence.",
