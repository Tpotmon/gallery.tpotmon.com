  "description": "Ilya Krauchunas is a software engineer whose Twitter is a constant feed of mundane personal updates about food, birds, and local scenery mingled with tech musings. His 'ability' mocks his endless, detailed posting and debugging nature — an ironic jab at how engineers obsess over minutiae. His attack is based on his frequent, somewhat awkward and overshared cooking posts, which come across as cringey and overly specific, making 'Cheesy Egg Whites Strike' fitting. The attack type is 'cringe' because his posts often border on awkward oversharing and light social discomfort. He’s weak to 'psyop' because subtle manipulations and confusing content could trip up his literal and detail-focused mindset, while he resists 'cringe' somewhat, as his personality leans into the awkwardness comfortably. His modest follower count and nanobie tier suggest lower hit points and attack damage.",
