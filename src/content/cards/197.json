  "description": "Aarav is a nanobie-tier user with a modest follower base and low engagement on original tweets but occasional viral retweets. The ability mocks his ironic struggle to build genuine engagement despite building a 'tweet engagement predictor.' His main attack revolves around retweeting small accounts to feign influence, which is cringe-worthy. Weakness to roast fits as sharp criticism would undercut his retweet echo chamber, while he resists cringe as he wallows in unoriginal awkwardness. The hp and attack damage reflect the nanobie tier and low traction on original posts. No furry or other special types present in profile or content.",
