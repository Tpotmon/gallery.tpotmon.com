  "description": "Raiko☆Star is a VTuber with a rare ultrabie tier, granting a high HP pool of 140. The Twitter content showcases a frequent use of awkward, confusing memes, nostalgic references, and odd questions that lean heavily into cringe territory, thus the attack is 'Raiko's Meme Beam' with a cringe type reflecting their awkward but persistent online presence. Their ability sarcastically mocks their alien persona and obsession with water, reflecting their bio humorously in 'Alien Water Thief.' Despite their cringe attack type, Raiko is quite resistant to cringe attacks themselves, as their entire brand is built around that awkward charm. They're weak to roast type, as sharp criticism and biting commentary would pierce their meme armor effectively.",
