  "description": "Lucas Beyer (bl16) is a megabie tier user with high hit points reflecting his large follower base and influential research role. His ability mocks his tendency to overwhelm his audience with dense AI jargon, ironically making his groundbreaking insights hard to digest. The attack centers on his viral tweet about forgetting a 4090 GPU running for months—both cringe-worthy and entertaining, fitting his hacker-gamer persona. His weakness is roast type, as sharp criticism and mocking attacks undermine his intellectual seriousness and expose his flaws, while he resists psyop type attacks due to his expertise in complex tech topics and research, making him less susceptible to manipulation or misinformation. His profile and tweets show no animal or furry content, so furry type is not applicable here. Overall the card balances sarcasm and respect for his high-tier professional presence and social influence.",
