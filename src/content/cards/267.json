  "description": "The user is a low-tier software developer and side project hustler who posts extensive technical updates about their writing platform and backend work, alongside personal fasting progress and self-mocking tweets. Their constant oversharing and awkward humor land them in the cringe attack type, with a modest attack damage reflecting limited traction. Their ability sarcastically mocks their need to announce even the tiniest update to maintain relevance. The attack name highlights their visible exhaustion and work obsession. They resist cringe attacks due to their familiarity with awkward sharing but are vulnerable to roasts that cut through their attempts at self-deprecation. No animal or furry themes were present despite some anime interest, so furry type was not chosen.",
