  "attackDescription": "Ash ▵ flattens the opponent with an endless stream of half-baked project launches, promises of big things 'coming soon', and awkward attempts at deep tech talks that barely land. It's more smoke than fire, but it still confuses the heck out of you.",

  "description": "Ash ▵ is a lowbie tier user with moderate engagement but a scattershot of futuristic ideas and tech enthusiasm, often vague or in-progress. Their profile and tweets show a heavy lean on tech, AI, and startup culture but with little sharp critique or drama. The sarcastic ability jabs at their grandiose self-label and overhyped promises. The attack mocks their indecisive and meandering project updates and habit of vague hype threads that confuse rather than convince, fitting 'psyop' type. They resist psyop type due to their own cryptic and confusing posting style but are weak to 'roast' because direct sharp criticism would puncture their self-serious bubble. Overall, no clues of furry or LGBTQ+ themes, and no aggressive or drama-intense behavior, so those types are excluded. The hit points and attack damage are at the low end of lowbie tier reflecting moderate follower count and modest engagement.",
