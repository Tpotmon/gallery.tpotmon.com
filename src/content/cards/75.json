  "description": "Given the user's 'Omnipresent record-keeper' identity combined with their relentless, mandatory-themed and hivemind propaganda-style posts, the ability sarcastically highlights their controlling, bureaucratic nature. The attack mocks their repetitive, regimented announcements about loyalty parades, dopamine rations, and controlled truth consumption, reflecting their low-tier but consistent manipulative presence (psyop type). They are weak to drama because controversy and emotional conflict undermine tightly controlled narratives, but resistant to psyop attacks due to their experience with manipulation and confusion tactics. Their lowbie tier limits HP and attack damage to the lower-middle ranges.",
