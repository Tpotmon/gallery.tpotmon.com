  "description": "The user is a lowbie tier designer who posts a lot of sarcastic and biting commentary, often roasting others online which inspired the 'rejex Roasts Reality' attack in the roast type category. Their ability ironically jabs at their tendency to procrastinate or stall on building actual projects despite a grand vision, reflected in 'Designer’s Procrastination'. Given their sarcastic and critical nature, they resist roast attacks but are weak to goon/aggressive confrontation since attacking their assertions or calling out their behavior might unnerve them. Their tweets and images show no indication of furry, gay, gaslight, or other specific themes, so roast fits best. Hit points are low but near the top of the lowbie range reflecting moderate engagement and followers.",
