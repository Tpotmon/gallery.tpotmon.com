  "description": "Ikki is a lowbie tier user based on follower count and engagement, thus hitPoints are moderate in the lowbie range. The ability mocks their self-deprecating 'zako' (weakling) persona from their bio, ironically granting immunity to 'weakling' attacks â€” a sarcastic jab at how harmless their content actually is. Their main attack, \"UwU Spammer,\" is inspired by their frequent posting of UwU culture and cute, often annoying tweets, fitting the 'cringe' type. Ikki is resistant to cringe attacks due to their own embrace of cringe content, but weak to sharp 'roast' style criticism that cuts through the fluff. They show no signs of aggressive or manipulative behavior, nor do they display animal-themed or LGBTQ+ exclusive content, so types like goon, psyop, furry, or gay were not selected. Their behavior and posts are low impact but consistent, hence a modest attack damage and hitPoints in the lowbie range.",
