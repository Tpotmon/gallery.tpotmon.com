  "description": "raZZ is a lowbie tier user with moderate engagement. His profile picture and tweets reveal a niche techy, ironic, and meme-based persona centered around Linux (Fedora) and coding culture. The ability mocks his trademark \"I use fedora btw\" trope, a well-known ironic internet style. The attack is based on a popular tweet boasting about his 'goated' cursor, roasting his attempts at relevance. Weakness to cringe is chosen because his humor and posts can be awkward or socially awkward, making embarrassing moments a good counter. He resists psyop as he often posts straightforward technical humor and memes rather than confusing or manipulative content. The furry type was not appropriate due to no evident animal/furry content. Overall, the card balances his ironic yet low-impact social presence.",
