  "description": "kazuto's card centers on his persistent, almost robotic morning blessings and gym motivational posts which flood his timeline, creating a cringe effect due to excessive positivity and spiritual repetition. His ability mocks his constant unsolicited spiritual 'charging' of followers, reflecting his profile's religious and tech vibe. His attack is named after his obsessive gym updates which, while well-intended, come off as embarrassingly repetitive, meriting a cringe designation. He is weak to roast attacks that can pierce through his incessant positivity by humorously criticizing it, while showing resistance to gay-type attacks as his content lacks LGBTQ+ themes. No furry content was evident in profile or tweets, so that type was not assigned.",
