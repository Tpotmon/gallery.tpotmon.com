  "description": "stonechat is an ultrabie-tier user with high follower engagement and a professional, tech-focused vibe. Their sarcastic ability 'Bug Roulette' reflects their admission that every attempted fix spawns new bugs, ironically forcing more chaos. Their signature attack 'Lock-In Logic' mocks their viral, boastful tweet about mastering any skill in six months â€” a perfect roast attack. Because they openly share frustrations about slow government and burnout but still maintain a calm, pragmatic tone, they resist roast attacks but are vulnerable to drama-type attacks that could exploit their occasional emotional outbursts. No furry or LGBTQ+ content was present, so those types are not assigned. This results in a card that's smart, ironic, and fittingly sharp.",
