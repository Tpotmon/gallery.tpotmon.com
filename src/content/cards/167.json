  "description": "kaios is a young megabie tier user, boasting a verified blue check and a hefty following. His tweets reveal a self-assured yet ironically fragile attitude, often blaming the algorithm for lack of engagement despite modest stats, fitting perfectly with a sarcastic 'CEO of Overestimation' ability. His attack mocks his repeated excuses and viral delusions, very psyop aligned by manipulating perception of success. Given this, he resists confusion and mind games but is highly vulnerable to sharp criticism that cuts through his ego. His high HP and attack damage reflect his megabie tier status and substantial follower base. The lack of animal or furry related content rules out furry type, and the subtle social media ego fits psyop better than drama or cringe.",
