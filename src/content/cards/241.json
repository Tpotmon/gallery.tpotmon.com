  "description": "Based on ✰λster✰'s profile as a Computer Engineering student with a strong focus on programming and software development, his ability mocks his coding snobbery and slightly elitist attitude towards IT roles. The attack 'Fibonacci Fail' directly references his popular tweet about the fibonacci coding interview test, using it as a basis for a sarcastic roast attack. He shows resistance to psyop (confusing or manipulative content) because of his technical mindset and logical approach but is weak to roast type attacks since criticism and sharp commentary hit him where it stings (ironic given his own roast attack style). Hit points are set in the highbie range (100) due to his substantial follower count and engagement, but not ultra or mega level. The media images and profile convey a serious tech vibe without furry or LGBTQ+ themes, so those types are omitted.",
