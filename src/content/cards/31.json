  "description": "This card reflects beckett‼️'s personality as a highbie with moderate hit points due to decent follower engagement and consistent posting. The ability mocks their constant 'skill issue' remarks, ironically blaming others while ignoring personal flaws. The attack 'Rizzler Roast' references their cringe-worthy 'rizzler' claim, roasting both their flirt attempts and online persona. Their weakness to roast type fits their vulnerability to sharp criticism, while resist to cringe reflects their comfort and immunity to awkward or out-of-touch content. Overall, the card captures beckett‼️'s sarcastic, self-aware, and sometimes awkward social media style with a sharp roasting edge.",
