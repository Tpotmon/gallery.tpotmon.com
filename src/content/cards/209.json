  "description": "Kristof is a megabie tier user with substantial followers and engagement, especially on AI, art, and tech topics. His profile and tweets portray a self-styled 'cult leader' of a digital monastery blending technology, theology, and art. His ability mocks this ironic digital mysticism and aura of obscure depth. The attack is derived from his clear tendency to drown his audience in buzzwords and techno-mystic philosophy, making his posts confusing and heavy with insider jargon, fitting a psyop attack type. Given his style, he is resistant to psyop type attacks (confusion and mind games), but weak to roast attacks, as sharp criticism and sarcasm cuts through his pretentious vibe. Hit points and attack power are high due to his megabie tier and notable influence, but weights are balanced against his sarcastic, self-important presentation.",
