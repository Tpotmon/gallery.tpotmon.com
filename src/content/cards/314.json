  "description": "With no tweets and barely any followers, fizzy ðŸ¥º is an ultra-nano newbie with a very low profile presence, reflected by low hit points and damage. The ability pokes fun at their 'new here' vibe and lack of content. The attack mocks the shy, empty engagement style. They are weak to drama, as any controversy would overwhelm their quiet presence, and resist gay-type attacks as nothing in their bio or media suggests LGBT themes. The card type chosen is cringe due to the awkward 'follow if you DARE!!!!' bio and complete lack of activity, signaling an ultimately awkward presence on the platform.",
