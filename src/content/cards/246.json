  "description": "Rafa is an Ultrabie tier user with 4102 followers and a strong technical and philosophical tweet history focusing on physics, complex systems, and controversial opinions. His ability 'Quantum Contradiction' ironically mocks his tendency to force new frameworks after confusing others with his ideas. The attack 'Physics Overload' reflects his typical behavior of overwhelming followers with dense, complicated content that alienates rather than engages, hence a strong psyop type. His resistance to psyop attacks is moderate due to his own manipulation and complexity in posts, but he is weak to roast as sharp criticism targeting his convoluted style hits hard. No evidence of furry, thirst, or explicitly LGBT content to merit those types. The profile and tweets reveal a serious yet ironically self-undermining style, perfect for a sarcastic jibe card.",
