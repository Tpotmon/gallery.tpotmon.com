  "description": "Hit Points are low due to nanobie tier. Ability mocks their obsession with coffee and existential tweeting that only energizes themselves. The attack targets their repeated needy Valorant and Twitter addiction posts, reflecting thirst behavior. Weakness to roast type attacks because sharp criticism cuts through their needy persona. Resistance to cringe because their awkward pleas are their natural habitat and hard to shake.",
