  "description": "As a megabie tier user with 13k followers and highly engaged tech-savvy content, ily⚡️ is a powerful card. The ability mocks the obsession with automation and AI replacing human work, a core theme of their tweets. The 'Regex Wreck' attack calls out their viral tweet about never writing regex manually, fitting their sharp roast style. The user resists drama due to their sarcastic confidence and high engagement but is weak to psyop, reflecting vulnerability to mind games given their contrarian takes and AI critiques.",
