  "description": "Ludwig is a megabie tier user with a strong tech, research-driven persona evidenced by high-impact tweets about building clusters, deep learning models, and hardware/software projects. His profile and tweets reflect a highly confident, almost sarcastic tone that mocks the impossible and elevates his achievements, inspiring the sarcastic ability 'Impossible Engineer' and the roasting attack 'Ludwig Loop' that mocks his repetitive humblebragging. His resistance to roast is high, as he thrives on sharp commentary himself, but he's weak to cringe content that exposes awkward moments or reveals embarrassing out-of-touch tech arrogance. No furry or LGBTQ+ content is present, so those types are irrelevant here. His high follower count and verified status justify a high hitPoints and attack damage.",
