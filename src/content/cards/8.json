  "description": "Khar Musk's card is designed around his highbie tier with hitPoints in the mid-range reflecting moderate influence and activity. His ability mocks his tech-heavy, jargon-laden tweets that ironically come off as confused autopilot rather than clear insight. The attack pulls from his sarcastic, often condescending tone that criticizes everything from politics to tech, perfected in his tweet insults like 'How does this man manage to be wrong consistently'. The attack type is 'roast' due to his sharp, biting commentary style. He resists 'psyop' types because his technical insights and factual approach make misleading tactics less effective. However, he is weak to 'drama' because his confrontational style and critical posts can provoke emotional conflicts that destabilize him. His profile picture and banner are serious and technological, reinforcing the AI/autonomy theme. Tweets include critical business, political, and tech analyses, often with a sarcastic jabâ€”no animal or furry content, so no furry type assigned.",
