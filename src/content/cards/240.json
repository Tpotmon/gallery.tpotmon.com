  "description": "Based on the profile and tweets, Nucleus☕️ is a high-tier builder persona with a megabie rating, justifying the high hit points and strong attack damage. The ability 'Builder's Block' sarcastically jabs at their tendency to boast about building but often devolve into complaints and shitposting. The 'Nucleus Nitpick' attack is drawn from their tweet style of harshly criticizing others' building efforts and mocking competitors, perfectly fitting the roast type. They show resistance to cringe due to their confident and sharp online persona but are weak to drama since conflicts and emotional controversies would likely disrupt their carefully maintained image and provoke stronger reactions.",
