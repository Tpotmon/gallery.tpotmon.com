  "description": "HSVSphere is a high-tier 'megabie' account with a strong follower base, high engagement, and a consistent, unyielding voice (hence a high HP near the top of the range). The ability mocks their self-proclaimed immutability and stubbornness in opinions, a key personality trait. The attack references their most-liked tweet about Yacine's hiring, an insider event they repeatedly highlight with pride and sarcasm, making it a perfect attack. The roast attack type fits their sharp and biting commentary style and disdain for others. The weakness to 'gaslight' is apt since their rigid opinions could crumble if their reality is questioned effectively. Their resistance to 'roast' comes from their defensive and sharp-tongued nature, making them resilient to criticism or insults. No furry content was present despite the colorful orb theme; thus, furry type wasn't assigned.",
