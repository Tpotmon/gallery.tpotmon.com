  "description": "UwU Underground is a high-tier ultrabie with strong hit points reflecting their influence. The ability 'Waifu Psyop' sarcastically jabs at their blend of AI anime waifus and nation state funding in infosec chaos. The attack 'UwU Meme Overload' roasts their repetitive meme-based psyops and cringe AI waifu content that floods the timeline. Due to their nature, they resist 'psyop' attacks effectively, as they themselves use that type of confusing content. However, sharp critique and roasting weakens them, as pointed commentary cuts through their chaotic veneer. They have no direct furry content despite the anime waifus, so 'psyop' is the best fit for attack and resistance, with weakness to 'roast' to balance.",
