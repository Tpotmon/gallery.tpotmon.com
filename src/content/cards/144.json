  "description": "Chosen for a hitPoints of 130 due to ultrabie's tier reflecting a notable but not top-tier influence. Ability sarcastically reflects their techno-optimist and AI dev identity with ironic confusion caused by jargon overload. Attack is named after their recursive prompts joke tweet, highlighting their behavior of tech and AI inside jokes with limited viral personal content. Psyop attack type fits due to their often complex, somewhat confusing AI and tech related tweets that can perplex followers. Weakness to gaslight is because their strong convictions and tech-centric worldview can be challenged by reality distortion or contradictory facts. They resist psyop effects due to their command over complex tech topics and jargon. No furry or other niche types apply since profile and tweets focus mainly on tech and political commentary, with no animal or anthro content present.",
