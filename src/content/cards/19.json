  "description": "ANGSUDO is a lowbie tier user with moderate following, mostly posting personal updates, Rust programming jokes, and daily life snippets. The ability mocks their tendency to spam notifications and irrelevant updates. The attack reflects their frequent sharing of Rust-related memes and awkward personal posts, which are a bit cringe-worthy and barely impactful. They resist cringe attacks slightly because their content already embodies it, but are vulnerable to psyop (confusion and mind games) due to their sometimes scattered and unfocused posts. No furry or other niche content was observed, so types like furry or drama do not apply here.",
