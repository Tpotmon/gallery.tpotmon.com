  "description": "This highbie user has decent hit points based on active engagement and follower count. The ability mocks his ironic pride in 'joblessness' contrasted with constant tech/startup obsession. His attack is a psyop type due to confusing, cryptic tech jokes and startup insider references that bewilder rather than clarify. Despite his awkwardness, he's resistant to cringe attacks because his style embraces awkward memes unapologetically. His vulnerability to roasts fits because sharp criticism about his self-bragging and startup hype would cut through his online persona's fragile ego. No furry or other niche type fits since no animal-themed content is present despite a quirky profile picture.",
