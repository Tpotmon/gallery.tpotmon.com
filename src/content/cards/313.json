  "description": "This user is an ultrabie tier with solid follower engagement and frequent cryptic, intergalactic-themed tweets and retweets. The ability mocks their ironic deep-dive into cosmic and quantum conspiracies that actually lead nowhere. Their key attack draws from their typical posting pattern of sharing enigmatic tweets and videos that mystify rather than clarify, hence classified as a psyop type. They resist other psyop attacks due to their confidence in their confusing style but are weak to drama since emotional conflicts and controversies would disrupt their cosmic calm. Their ultrabie status gave them higher hit points and attack damage.",
