  "description": "This card reflects Nic's ultrabie tier with solid HP to match his decent follower count and frequent posting. His ability mocks his self-proclaimed work ethic vs actual genius; he never claims to be smart but tries to outlast others. The attack riffs on his posts filled with bland motivational 'hustle' messages that come off as try-hard and awkward (cringe type). He resists cringe due to embracing it, but is weak to roast given his thin skin for criticism. The presence of a cat photo suggests minimal furry influence, so that type wasn't used. Overall, the card sarcastically highlights his overconfident but underwhelming persona, frequent 'deep' quotes, and struggle to gain real traction beyond mild engagement.",
