  "description": "Joca is a nanobie-tier Brazilian CS undergrad who likes to complain about programming and work struggles, showing a classic indecisive and slightly bitter vibe. The ability mocks their wannabe software engineering claims and issue-tracking focus. The attack is based on their most liked tweet where they ask followers to choose a language, highlighting indecision and lack of action, thus a cringe type. The user is weak to roasts because they are sensitive to criticism evident by their frequent complaints and emotional posts, but resistant to psyops as their posts show straightforward gripes rather than manipulation or confusion. There's no animal or furry content so no furry type assigned.",
