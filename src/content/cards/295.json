  "description": "This user's content is mostly low-tier philosophical musings and personal daily life moments mixed with some Japanese culture and language learning, fitting a lowbie tier with modest HP. Their ability mocks their indecisiveness on big questions like life and death, fitting the sarcastic tone requested. Their attack is based on their cringe-worthy tweets like the geography fail (Montreal in Brazil) and mundane personal stories, making 'cringe' the best attack type. They resist cringe slightly due to frequent posting of awkward content but are weak to roast because they don't handle sharp criticism well. No animal or furry themes detected in profile or tweets, thus 'cringe' fits better than commonly default types.",
