  "description": "Given the user describes themselves as a 'professional schizoposter' and 'resident gooner', their ability ironically mocks their tendency to lurk and avoid genuine interaction, while the attack is based on lurking and retweeting chaotic content which harms their presence with confusing goon-ish behavior. Their weakness is sharp criticism ('roast') since their persona crumbles under honest critique, but they resist psyop attacks as they thrive in confusing and manipulative online spaces. No evidence of furry or other niche interests, and their tier 'nanobie' sets low hitpoints and damage.",
