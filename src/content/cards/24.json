  "description": "Marty is an ultrabie rare tier with solid HP reflecting a strong but not invincible presence. His ability ironically mocks his status as a 'regular dude' and dad with plenty of random, mostly useless advice and thoughtsâ€”perfectly matching his tweet tone. His attack is based on his parenting tweets and chaotic digital rants, delivering an awkward, cringe-infused hit. Despite this, he resists cringe well, showing he's used to it, but is weak to roast attacks, as sharp criticism punctures his inflated self-image and 'main character vibe.' Overall, his profile picture and banner are casual and normal, not furry or flamboyant, so no special type like furry or gay fits better than cringe and roast. His tweet style is casual, self-deprecating, and random, making cringe and roast the best complementary types.",
