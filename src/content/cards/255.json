  "description": "The lowbie tier suggests modest hit points reflecting a modest following and impact. The ability mocks their frequent dry, uneventful posts and low interaction, highlighting the boredom and dullness they project. The attack targets their repetitive, low-engagement 'echo chamber' style tweets that fail to spark any real conversation or excitement, making the attack cringe-inducing. Weakness to drama is chosen because stirring up emotional conflicts would disrupt their dry, low-key vibe. Resistance to psyop is used since their posts don’t seem manipulative or confusing, showing resilience to confusion tactics.",
