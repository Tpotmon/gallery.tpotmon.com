  "description": "The user's profile and tweet history reflect a strong ultrabie tier with a flair for edgy, self-deprecating humor and ongoing drama, often involving sharp criticism and conflict. Their ability ironically embraces their own behavior, boosting resilience. Their main attack is based on their frequent dramatic and combative tweets, particularly their self-aware insults and passive-aggressive style. They resist drama well but are vulnerable to sharp roasts that cut deeper than their own jabs.",
