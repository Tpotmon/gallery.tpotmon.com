  "description": "Harry Gonzalez's card has moderate-high hit points reflecting his highbie status. The ability mocks his unwavering 'American values' stance and refusal to entertain opposing views, making him resistant to gaslighting but ironically weak to sharp criticism ('roast') which cuts through his self-seriousness. His attack is a gaslight type, reflecting his tendency to dogmatically assert moral and intellectual superiority while twisting conversations, which can confuse but isn't very damaging. The attack damage is mid-range to reflect some traction in influential posts but not overwhelming power. Choice of types strictly matches his behavior, with no animal or LGBTQ+ content, thus no furry or gay types. His profile pics and banner are standard political profile style, no furry influence. This results in a card that sarcastically jabs at his inflexible ideology and rhetoric style.",
