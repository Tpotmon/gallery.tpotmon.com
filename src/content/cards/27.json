  "description": "Ranju's highbie tier suggests solid health but not ultra dominance, hence 100 HP. His ability mocks the eternal procrastination fueled by coffee and tech-brained humor, reflecting his profile and tweets of mixed tech musings and memes. The attack, 'Mediocre Meme Drop,' is a jab at his underwhelming viral content and frequent tech jokes that fail to impress broadly, placing it in cringe type with moderate damage. He resists cringe attacks, showing his tolerance to awkwardness, but has weakness to roast type, which targets sharp, biting commentary, perfect for countering his meme-heavy, procrastination-forward style.",
