  "description": "Antwon Kreed is a lowbie tier user with moderate influence (631 followers) and a profile that blends gaming, writing, and voice acting with a sharp tongue. His ability mocks his self-appointed role as an internet justice warrior who can't help but insult others, turning his good intentions into social alienation. The attack reflects his tendency to publicly call out content theft and low-effort behavior with harsh language, often backfiring or stirring backlash. Kreed resists roast attacks somewhat due to his own sharp commentary nature but is weak to goon-style aggressive confrontations since he prefers verbal sparring over direct bullying. The low hit points and attack damage correspond to his middle-tier status, and the lack of furry or LGBTQ+ content excludes those types. His profile pictures and tweets show no distinct animal or anthro themes, so furry type is not assigned.",
