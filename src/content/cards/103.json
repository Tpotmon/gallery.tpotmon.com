  "description": "The hitPoints are low due to the 'lowbie' tier, giving a modest health pool. The ability mocks the user's 'Cybernetic Detective - Vibe Salesman' persona by ironically highlighting their lack of engagement ('unread DMs'). The attack is inspired by the user's repetitive vague work-related tweets like 'Well, time to make that bread. Later nerds.' which try to sound cool but fall flat, thus a roast type attack fits. They resist gaslighting because their tweets often play with cryptic and slightly detached vibes, implying some resistance to reality questioning. Weakness is 'cringe' because their awkward or out-of-touch posts and modest social traction make them vulnerable to embarrassment-based attacks. No furry content is present despite animal pictures, so no furry type is assigned.",
