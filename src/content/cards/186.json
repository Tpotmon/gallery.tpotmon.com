  "description": "The user's profile clearly shows a fascination with AI and automation to avoid work, inspiring an ability that sarcastically jabs at delegating effort entirely. The attack is crafted from his numerous tweets about creating AI and robots to do his job, highlighting his procrastination under the guise of productivity. Given his low follower count and modest engagement, the attack damage and hit points align with a lowbie tier. Psyop fits well since the user often talks about futuristic ideas that could confuse or manipulate. He resists similar psyop tactics but is weak to roast attacks which might expose the irony in his laziness. There is no furry content or aggressive behavior, so those types weren't appropriate. The ability and attacks are shaped by his profile picture and banner showing a relaxed vibe and his tweets about AI, robots, and casual tech commentary.",
