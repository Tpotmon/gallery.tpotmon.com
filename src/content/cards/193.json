  "description": "The user is nanobie tier, so low hit points are appropriate. The ability sarcastically jabs at their 'I'm not afraid' stance despite posting chaotic and controversial content, especially retweets. Their attack is based on heavy retweeting of viral and meme content with little original substance, acting like a psyop that confuses followers. They are weak to roasting criticism which would expose their lack of originality, but resistant to similar confusing psyop content. Their profile and tweets show no animal or furry content despite the casual tone, so furry type is not assigned. The sarcastic and ironic tone matches the user's style and content perfectly.",
