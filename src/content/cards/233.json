  "description": "Dan is a tech-savvy ultrabie with rare status, reflected in his high hit points and attack damage. His ability mocks his tendency to let projects run unattended on 'auto pilot,' highlighting ironic laziness despite a tech-driven profile. The attack is a 'psyop' type because he often posts confusing, niche tech content and cryptic hints about projects, which muddles understanding. He resists psyop attacks due to familiarity with complex tech topics. However, he is weak to roast attacks, as cutting criticism about his tech arrogance or forgetfulness would hit hard. There are no furry themes or LGBTQ+ content, so those types are not applied. His cover and profile pictures are non-animal and professional, supporting this analysis.",
