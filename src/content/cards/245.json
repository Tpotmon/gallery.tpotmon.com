  "description": "Joowon is a megabie-tier user with high influence and engagement, so high hit points and a strong attack damage are fitting. His ability sarcastically highlights his obsessive promotion of himself as the top engineer—which looks ironically ego-driven and typical of tech bro culture. The attack is based on his viral 'vibe coder' tweet and other posts that mock tech wannabes, perfectly fitting a roast type that uses dry biting humor. He resists roast attacks due to his experience firing sarcastic shots but is weak to drama because his tech industry hustle persona thrives on keeping things professional and measured; emotional controversies would hit hard. No furry or LGBTQ+ themes appear, so those types are not used. The profile and tweets justify a roast attack and resistance, with weakness to drama to counterbalance.",
