  "attackDescription": "Yoko destroys your defenses with endless cat-themed art and cat mom vibes, overwhelming you with adorableness that makes it impossible to fight back. It’s a cute attack, but still a total beatdown.",

  "description": "Yoko㊙️’s card is built around her ultrabie tier and artistic, dreamy presence with strong cat mom vibes seen in her profile and tweets featuring cat girl and animal themes, giving her the furry attack and a decent attack damage fitting ultrabie tier. Her ability ironically jabs at her monetization pause, suggesting a mysterious, indecisive nature. She is weak to roast because sharp criticism would cut through her dreamy cat aesthetics, while resistant to cringe due to her polished art style and consistent posting of quality content that avoids awkwardness.",
