  "description": "Aditya has a lowbie tier with modest hit points reflecting his small yet active following. His ability mocks his unusual fixation on Jeera and Dhaniya, which is a quirky but confusing personality trait that ironically hampers recognition or serious engagement. The attack is based on his frequent retweets and low-engagement anime and movie posts, which come off as cringeworthy rather than impactful, hence a low damage and cringe type. He's weak to sharp criticism (roast) because his content lacks strong original commentary and could be easily pierced by it. He's moderately resistant to psyop attacks due to the somewhat confusing and scattered nature of his posts making manipulative tactics less effective.",
