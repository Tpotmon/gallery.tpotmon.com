  "description": "This user is a highbie tier with moderate hitpoints reflecting decent engagement and follower count. The ability mocks their ironic obsession with dining room tables and Impossible Burgers despite a complex history (regional manager roles). Their attack is based on their self-described 'replyguy' persona flooding the feed with unwanted commentary, fitting a roast type. They resist roast attacks due to their comfort in sarcasm and criticism but are weak to drama, as they spread plenty of retweets and content that can ignite controversy and emotional conflicts. No furry or other niche types appear based on their content and images, so roast fits best.",
