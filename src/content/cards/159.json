  "description": "Hitpoints are low-middle range because teflon is lowbie tier with moderate followers and activity but no verified status. Ability mocks the ironic 'jack of many offs' self-description and sporadic original content combined with heavy retweeting. The attack is named for their habit of flooding the timeline with retweets and relying on others’ viral posts rather than original value. This behavior is cringe-worthy as it shows lack of authentic presence. Weakness to roast fits as sharp criticism pierces their weak originality and makes them uncomfortable. Resistance to drama comes from their passive retweet style, avoiding direct online confrontations or stirring conflict. No furry or LGBTQ+ theme found despite images and varied content. Overall, a card that teases a lowbie Twitter lurker who prefers to amplify others instead of forging their own path.",
