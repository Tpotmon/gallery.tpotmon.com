  "description": "Tushit is a lowbie tier coder struggling through school and project chaos, reflected by modest hit points. Their ability mocks their never-ending project starts and complaints, highlighting procrastination and indecision. The attack references their multiple tweets whining about Leetcode and coding struggles, wielding confusion and coder angst (psyop). They are weak to sharp criticism and roasting due to their visible insecurity over projects and status. They resist cringe because their self-aware awkwardness makes typical embarrassing posts less effective. No furry or other special types apply as no animal themes appear in their profile or tweets.",
