  "description": "The card's hit points are high due to the user's ultrabie tier and verified rare status. The sarcastic ability 'Never Yifei Yourself' riffs on their own motto and cryptic personality, reflecting their ironic, elitist, and inside-joke driven style. The attack 'Frontend Flex' targets their frequent boastful frontend dev posts laden with insider tech slang that alienates common folk, hence a psyop type attack, confusing opponents. Their weakness to roast is because sharp criticism can pierce their inflated ego and sarcastic tone. They resist psyop attacks well, as they themselves wield confusion and manipulation effectively. No furry or animal content was present, so that type wasn't assigned.",
