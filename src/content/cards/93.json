  "description": "The hitPoints reflect a highbie tier user with decent follower engagement. The ability mocks the user's self-described 'Mildly Manic' persona, blending tech insights with erratic energy. His most common theme is about software bugs and build failures, leading to the attack 'Zek's Bugged Build' which is a cringe-type reflecting the frustrating cycle of fixing that worsens problems. Psyop is his weakness due to his statements about AI manipulation and skepticism towards tech trends. Resistant to drama because he rarely stirs controversy but rather comments sarcastically. The profile and tweets have no animal or furry content, so furry type isn't used. The sarcastic tone suits his social media style.",
