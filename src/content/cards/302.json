  "description": "Faa is tiered as lowbie with hit points at the lower end of the range reflecting modest follower count but high engagement in niche topics like ADHD and tech commentary. Their ability humorously points to the obsession with massive favourites and casual friendliness masking an attention-hungry persona. The attack is built around their biggest viral tweet about managing ADHD that got thousands of likes, highlighting cringe in trying too hard to be informative like a low-level influencer. Weakness to roast fits due to their tendency to be overly earnest and vulnerable to sharp criticism. Resistance to cringe makes sense since they consistently produce self-aware or awkward content and can shrug off typical cringe exposure. No furry or other special types detected despite some animal references; their style is more tech-cringe focused.",
