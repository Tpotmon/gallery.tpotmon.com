  "description": "Tortyl's card reflects a highbie tier with 100 HP representing decent influence and activity. The ability sarcastically jabs at the user's mix of surprisingly deep posts and absurd humor about bodily functions. The attack is named after their repeated behavior of reposting 'cheeks' or suggestive imagery, which fits cringe due to the awkward and borderline embarrassing content style. Weakness is roast because sharp criticism and biting commentary would effectively counter their often awkward and provocative posts. Resistance to psyop is chosen because their content doesn't fall into misleading or manipulative, so mind games won't work well against them. The profile picture and banner show a turtle emphasizing a laid-back yet quirky vibe, but no animal/furry content so no furry type applied.",
