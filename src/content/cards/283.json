The content is highly controversial and offensive, often stirring drama with conspirational and hateful rhetoric, which fits perfectly with the 'drama' attack type. The ability 'Drama Magnet' reflects their tendency to attract and create controversy. The attack is a direct jab at the user's provocative posting style which consistently triggers and alienates others.
