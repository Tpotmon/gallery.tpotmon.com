  "description": "CrossProduct is a lowbie tier user with moderate hit points reflecting their beginner status. The ability mocks their self-proclaimed ML expertise and research group affiliation, highlighting the irony of having no real breakthroughs. Their main attack centers on their heavy reliance on retweets, many of which are viral but lack originality, making for a cringe-worthy spammy style. They're weak to roast-type attacks that criticize and call out their lack of originality. They resist psyop types, as their tech-savvy background likely makes them less susceptible to manipulation or confusing content. No furry or other thematic types were chosen since their content and profile lack animal or anthro imagery or references. The cover picture and profile picture portray a serious, artistic professional vibe but with no playful animal themes.",
