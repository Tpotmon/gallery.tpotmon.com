  "description": "Rog's 'dystopian future' profile theme inspired an ability that ironically blocks genuine interaction, reflecting their often passive content style. Their most impactful activity is retweeting viral startup and AI hype tweets, which suits a psyop attack typeâ€”confusing opponents with buzzword-filled noise rather than original insight. Their weakness to roast reflects how criticism and sharp commentary would cut through their derivative content and attitude. They resist psyop because they themselves post manipulative or confusing retweets, making them less vulnerable to similar attacks.",
