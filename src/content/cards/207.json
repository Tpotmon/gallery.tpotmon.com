  "description": "CL is a megabie tier user with a huge follower count and a sophisticated, cryptic posting style blending finance, tech, and cat-themed humor. Their ability ironically mocks their highbrow meme-posting style that often leaves audiences puzzled but pretending to be impressed. Their attack is based on their tendency to confuse with technical and geopolitical tweets filled with insider or complex references, delivering a damaging 'quantum' style psyop. Weakness is roast because sharp criticism and biting commentary effectively disrupt their intellectual facade. Resistance is psyop since their content already thrives on confusion and complexity, making them less affected by it.",
