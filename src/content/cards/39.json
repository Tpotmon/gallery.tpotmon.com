  "description": "Joey's card reflects their low-tier status with modest hit points and attack power. The profile picture and tweets show a strong fox/furry theme (fox references, fox profile pic), so the attack type is 'furry'. Their sleepy, reclusive, and meme-sharing behavior inspired the sarcastic ability 'Foxy Procrastination' poking fun at their lack of real engagement. Their attack mocks their constant tiredness combined with 'cuddle champion' claims, making it a 'Sleepy Cuddle Ambush'. Weakness is 'goon' for aggressive direct confrontations, which would unsettle a sleepy recluse. Resistance is 'cringe' due to their self-aware humor and meme savvy, making them resistant to embarrassment or awkwardness attacks.",
