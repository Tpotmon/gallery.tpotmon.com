  "description": "Miao’s card has high HP due to megabie tier status and 88k followers. The ability mocks their tendency to retweet and amplify others’ content instead of original work. The attack targets their heavy reliance on viral retweets and viral echo chamber behavior, sarcastically noting the lack of original content. The attack type is 'psyop' because retweets often manipulate discourse through spreading misleading or emotionally charged content. Weakness is 'roast' since sharp critical commentary exposes the emptiness of recycled viral posts. Resistance to 'psyop' depicts their comfort in manipulating or amplifying confusing/misleading content. There is no furry type assigned as the single cat image 'Neko' is minimal and not a recurring or strong furry theme.",
