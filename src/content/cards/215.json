  "description": "HitPoints are high due to ultrabie tier and verified influential profile with 4K+ followers and highly engaged content. The ability 'Rusty Ego' sarcastically jabs at his defensive, cult-like promotion of Rust and bitcoin. The attack 'Peak Design Roast' directly references his most viral tweet mocking design, fitting his sharp sarcastic tone. He resists roast attacks due to sharp commentary but is weak to psyop since confusing or manipulative content counters his technical dogmatism. Chose roast attackType because his tweets often criticize and mock with sharp wit. The profile and tweets show no furry or LGBTQ+ content so those types were not assigned. Overall, the card captures Lukáš's biting technical commentary, cultish promotion of Rust, and viral meme-based attacks.",
