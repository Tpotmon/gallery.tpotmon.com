  "description": "Oyasumi is a lowbie tier user with modest followers and moderate tweeting about cybersecurity, coding, and daily struggles. Their posts reflect a mix of hopeful building and frequent failures, often shared in a casual, slightly ironic style. The ability mocks their persistent optimism despite setbacks. The attack targets their tendency to overhype mundane or failing progress in a cringe-worthy way. They resist psyop types because their posts are clear, honest, and low on manipulative content. They are weak to roast because direct sharp critiques would hit their thin social media confidence hard. No furry or LGBTQ+ content found despite some personal vibe posts, so those types were not assigned.",
