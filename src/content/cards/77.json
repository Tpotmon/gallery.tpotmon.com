  "description": "Tawny is an ultrabie tier user with a rare card reflecting their high engagement and follower count. The ability mocks their prolific and contradictory tweeting style, often about art, identity, and tech, showing a complex, self-aware persona. The attack is psyop type, derived from their frequent quirky, confusing, and deep posts that twist logic and emotions. They resist psyops well due to their own cryptic style but are vulnerable to roast-type attacks because sharp criticism exposes their ironic and sometimes performative posts. There is no furry type assignment since no animal or anthro content appears. The hit points and attack damage reflect their ultrabie tier and strong social influence.",
