  "description": "giatt is a megabie tier user with a hefty follower count and high engagement, reflected in strong hit points and attack damage. Their ability mocks their repetitive pattern of starting and giving up, inspired by their self-penned life cycle tweets about quitting and relapsing into bad habits. The attack roasts their frequent boasting about money and provocative relationship tweets that stir controversy but also cause personal embarrassment. They are most vulnerable to psyop attacks, fitting their inconsistent mind state and lack of focus, while they resist drama well, showing a tolerance for conflict and heated interactions. The user's posts lack furry or LGBTQ+ themes, so those types were excluded. The profile picture and tweets show a raw and unfiltered persona prone to self-sabotage and edgy commentary, fitting the roast attack type perfectly.",
