  "description": "Mickey's tweets show a pattern of personal drama and emotional struggles, so their ability mocks their tendency to stall on projects and tweets. Their attack is based on their most liked tweet about stepping away due to family issues, portraying it as a melodramatic exit. Because they provoke drama and emotional content, they are weak to drama-type counters but resist cringe due to their self-aware, witty tone. Their profile and tweets lack animal or furry content, so furry type was not applicable.",
