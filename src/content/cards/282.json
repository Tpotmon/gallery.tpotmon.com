  "description": "This user creates an aura of cryptic, esoteric content often involving mystical or divine themes, which fits perfectly with a \"psyop\" attack type reflecting confusing and manipulative content. Their notable tweets suggest a style of posting that leaves readers mystified rather than informed. The ability is sarcastic about their 'mysterious wisdom' that mostly just baffles. The attack references their signature opaque and cryptic posting style. Despite their mystical and somewhat confused posts, they are apparently resistant to similar confusing attacks (psyop) but vulnerable to drama, as emotional controversy would likely disrupt their calm, cryptic persona. Their tier is 'highbie' so their hit points and attack damage fall into the mid-upper ranges for that tier.",
