  "description": "edric is a lowbie tier user with moderate follower count and lots of self-deprecating, awkward posts about tech, AI, sugar cravings, and general life confusion, which fits the 'cringe' attack type well. His ability mocks his indecisiveness and amateur AI ambitions ironically. His attack is the 'Cringe Code' because of his painfully awkward tech struggles and personal woes, often shared openly and without filter. He resists 'cringe' due to being used to embarrassment but is weak to 'roast' because sharp criticism and sarcasm would cut through his awkwardness effectively. No animal or furry themes appear in profile or tweets, so no furry type assigned. Overall, the card reflects a painfully relatable, low-level tech novice still fumbling through life and social media.",
