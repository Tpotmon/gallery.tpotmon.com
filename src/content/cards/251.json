  "description": "Kion is an ultrabie tier user with a large following and active engagement, mostly centered around creating a cringe-filled, self-aware persona. The ability 'Cringe Overload' mocks their admission as a 'Cringe lord' and how their content aggressively embraces awkwardness. The attack 'WagieWeeb Wreck' taps into their pattern of self-deprecating humor and meme-heavy posts that are highly cringe-worthy but also form their main content style. Their attack is strong reflecting decent traction on posts. The weakness to 'roast' type is a jab at how sharp criticism undermines their cringe armor, while resistance to 'cringe' reflects their comfort in that content style. No furry or other animal themes were found, so a 'cringe' attack type is fitting. Overall, the card balances Kion's ironic self-branding and online behavior.",
