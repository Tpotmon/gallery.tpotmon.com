  "description": "The lowbie tier reflects arkephi’s modest follower count but active presence. The ability mocks their tendency to dampen excitement around AI with sarcastic dryness. The attack is based on their persistent posting of dense, technical, and often under-engaging commentary that irritates or bores rather than excites. Cringe fits due to their awkward social and tech commentary style. They resist psyop due to their sharp analytical mind that sees through confusion, but are weak to drama since emotional conflicts would throw off their technical, detached persona.",
