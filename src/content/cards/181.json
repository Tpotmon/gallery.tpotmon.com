  "description": "Iyasu’s card is a lowbie tier with minimal HP reflecting a modest but active presence. The ability mocks the user’s meme-obsessed and cat-emojified tweets that ironically lack real meme punch. The attack name references their frequent complaints about the mailman and weather, which are painfully mundane and cringe-worthy as social media content. Their weakness to drama suits the fact that they avoid controversy and emotional conflicts, while they resist furry type attacks due to a strong cat/cute pet theme in the profile pictures and many tweets about cats and feline emojis.",
