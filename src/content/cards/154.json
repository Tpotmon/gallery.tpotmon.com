  "description": "Shivangi is a highbie-tier user with 2839 followers, verified account, and a strong focus on tech, reading, and building. Her tweets often mix self-aware humor with light sarcasm, especially about minor internet struggles like losing drafts or celebrating small wins. This inspired the gaslight ability, ironically portraying how she boosts her aura by convincing herself of positive spins on setbacks. The main attack mocks her tendency to overvalue small likes as bangers, which reveals a fragile social validation needâ€”a perfect target for roast attacks which counter her gaslighting well. She resists gaslight type attacks in return due to her own self-aware ironic jabs. No furry or LGBTQ+ content was evident, and her content is not aggressive or manipulative enough for goon or psyop types, so gaslight and roast fit best. Her hit points align with highbie tier (100) and attack damage moderate (50) to reflect decent but not massive influence.",
