  "description": "With an ultrabie tier and 135 HP, WaifuDev is moderately durable. The ability mocks their ironic and somewhat depressing take on Twitter as isolating rather than connecting, reflecting their repeated tweets about social media's negative effects. The attack is named 'Retweet Rampage' because many tweets are retweets, often ironic or anime-related, showing a tendency to lean on recycled content. The attack type is 'psyop' because their content is often manipulative and confusing, blending irony and edgy commentary. WaifuDev resists psyop attacks due to their own mastery of manipulative content, but is weakened by 'drama' attacks, as their posts show signs of frustration with social platforms and social conflicts, making emotional controversies their Achilles' heel.",
