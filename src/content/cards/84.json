  "description": "CARZEN is a highbie user with moderate hit points reflecting active and frequent posting but not top-tier clout. Their ability mocks their penchant for hilarious derailments and off-topic commentary. The attack name and description are inspired by their viral retweet about 'Yacine's commits' which gained massive traction, demonstrating their reliance on popular memes and inside jokes. The roast attack type fits well as their content often comments sharply on situations. Weakness to drama stems from their tolerance for serious conversations being upended, while they resist cringe because their style is confident and self-aware. No furry or LGBTQ+ themed content is present, so those types are not assigned.",
