  "description": "As a megabie with 20k followers and extremely high tweet activity, @sage's card gets maxed HP. His content is deeply spiritual, apocalyptic, and cryptic, often projecting intense divine messaging and conspiratorial warningsâ€”hence the psyop attack type reflecting his manipulative, confusing spiritual rhetoric. His ability mocks his self-serious and cryptic style by flooding opponents with overwhelming spiritual aesthetics. His weakness is roast because sharp criticism and sarcasm would undercut his high-minded persona, while he's resistant to psyop due to his own mastery of manipulative and confusing messaging. Despite many visual tweets, no animal or furry references are present, so furry type is not assigned. The attack name references his frequent intense sermons and ominous truths, roasting his relentless seriousness and self-importance.",
