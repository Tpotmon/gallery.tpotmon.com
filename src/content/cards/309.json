  "description": "Lukas seidel is a highbie-tier infosec researcher and firmware hacker who regularly posts deeply technical content and niche humor. His ability mocks his endless academic and firmware research, sarcastically jabbing at his tunnel vision on complex topics. His signature attack targets his viral 'u.s. graphics' meme post, deploying a harsh but nerdy roast that only insiders appreciate. Given his highly technical and confident posts, he resists psyop-type confusion and manipulation but is weak to cringe content that embarrasses or awkwardly exposes his niche-nerd persona. His hitPoints reflect his highbie tier (100 HP) and attack damage is mid-high for that tier (55). The diverse content justifies using roast and cringe types primarily, with resistance to psyop representing his expertise and clarity in complex topics.",
