  "description": "Given Aryan Zutshi's nanobie tier, hit points and attack damage are low. His tweets heavily focus on coding, grind culture, and developer updates, which come off as earnest but painfully awkward and repetitive, justifying a 'cringe' attack type. The ability 'Endless Debugging' sarcastically jabs at how his improvements ironically cause more problems. His resistance to 'psyop' reflects his tech-savvy, likely not falling for manipulative posts, while his weakness to 'roast' aligns with how criticism and sharp commentary would expose his limited influence and repetitive content style. No animal or furry content detected, so furry type was not assigned.",
