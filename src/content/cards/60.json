  "description": "Akshat is a nanobie tier coder with modest follower count and limited viral traction, so hitPoints are low (35). Ability sarcastically mocks his self-confessed low attention span and half-finished projects, turning them into a confusing code puzzle — hence 'psyop'. His strongest attack is based on his Twitter announcing new web app projects and dashboards, but they lack wow-factor or hype, thus 'Lowbie Launch' is a weak psyop attack. Akshat is weak to drama because direct controversy or emotional conflict would disrupt his calm coding facade. He resists cringe as his posts are more about technical skill attempts rather than awkward or embarrassing content. No furry or LGBTQ+ content found, so no assignment of those types. Overall, a low-tier, earnest coder with sporadic modest engagement.",
