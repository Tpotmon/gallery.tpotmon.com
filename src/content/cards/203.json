  "description": "Given loveofdoing's profile as a self-taught philosopher and cognitive scientist who frequently posts cryptic, dense tweets involving AI, politics, and in-group/out-group dynamics, their ability mocks their tendency to overthink and confuse. The strongest attack is a psyop type based on their verbose, jargon-rich Vibecamp event tweets that likely baffle outsiders. They resist psyop attacks due to their manipulation of confusing content but are weak to roast, reflecting vulnerability to sharp, direct criticism or sarcasm that calls out their pretentiousness. Their ultrabie tier yields high hit points and attack damage. No furry type was assigned as there are no evident animal or anthro themes in profile or tweets.",
