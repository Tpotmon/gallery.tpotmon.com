  "description": "With a profile stating 'none of my posts are real' and a self-proclaimed 'evil liar', this user embraces deception and surreal humor, making 'Lemon Lies All Day' a fitting ability. Their attack roasts others with obscure, sarcastic tweets that dive into awkward and cringe territory, hence a 'cringe' attack type. They are weak to sharp criticism ('roast'), as their identity hinges on ironic lies and self-deprecation, and resistant to confusing or manipulative tactics ('psyop'), reflecting their already confusing and meme-like content. Despite no explicit animal or furry content, their computer and tech theme plus ironic style avoid fuzzy or specific niche types, settling on these for a balanced and fitting card representing their highbie tier and uncommon rarity.",
