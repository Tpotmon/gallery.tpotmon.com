  "description": "Hit points are high due to ultrabie tier reflecting a well-established, verified fintech engineer with solid follower count and active engagement. The ability sarcastically mocks their tendency to rely heavily on retweets and automation in their content mix, fitting their engineer persona and automation theme. The attack roasts their repetitive retweeting and fintech jargon posts, which dominate their timeline, effectively weaponizing their lack of originality or humor. Psyop is chosen as attack type for their manipulative and confusing tech-savvy post style, also resisting same type due to their strong command of tech topics. Weakness to roast fits as sharp criticism exposes the shallow originality behind their posts, cutting through their otherwise polished facade.",
