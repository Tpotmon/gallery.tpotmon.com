  "description": "This card is a lowbie tier with hit points on the lower side due to moderate follower count and engagement. The ability mocks the user's shader contrast posts and their struggle to gain attention. The attack is based on their repeated desperate asks for followers and cofounders, invoking awkwardness and cringe. The attack type is 'cringe' reflecting their sometimes awkward indie dev vibes. They are weak to 'roast' as sharp criticism cuts through their self-deprecating humor and desperation. They resist 'cringe' since they are quite familiar with their own awkward persona and aren't easily fazed by it.",
