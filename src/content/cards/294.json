  "description": "McKenzie Girl is a highbie tier user with moderate followers and high tweet count, posting mostly philosophical, artistic, and introspective content. Her ability mocks her tendency to share deep yet possibly confusing thoughts that confuse others ironically. The attack is based on her style of posting cryptic, conceptual art-inspired messages that can mentally drain but rarely cause direct impact, thus a moderate attack damage. Psyop is fitting for her bewildering intellectual posts. She is weak to gaslighting since skewing her perceived reality can undercut her philosophical certainty. Resistant to psyop because she thrives on confusing and complex ideas herself.",
