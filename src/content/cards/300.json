  "description": "stink is a highbie-tier user with a decent follower base and high engagement on retweets, especially sharing historic or niche content. His posts often have a cryptic or ironic tone, hinting at creating problems to solve which inspired 'Problem Solver Syndrome' ability. He frequently amplifies others' tweets and obscure references, leading to a confusing feed—thus a psyop attack type fits with 'Stink’s Shitstorm' attack, representing his confusing and manipulative retweeting behavior. His weakness is drama, as direct emotional conflicts would disrupt his subtle influence, while he resists psyop types due to his own aptitude for cryptic manipulation. The profile and tweets mention his dog and German Shepherd references, but the furry element is minor, so 'furry' type was not chosen. His cynical and ironic style is better represented by psyop and drama types.",
