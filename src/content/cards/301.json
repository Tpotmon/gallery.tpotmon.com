  "description": "As a lowbie tier user with ~733 followers and mostly low-like tweets except for a few retweets, the hit points are low-ish (30). The ability mocks his complicated, cryptic comedic style from profile and tweets filled with AI, crypto, and tech references mixed with humor. His attack is based on his repeated petty drama about ruined trips and Karen incidents, which are low impact but annoying, fitting a 'drama' attack type with modest damage. He is weak to sharp criticism ('roast') since he thrives on drama but likely can't handle direct burns. He resists drama somewhat as he cultivates this style as his defense. No furry or other types apply due to lack of animal or LGBTQ+ themes. The sarcastic and ironic tone reflects his posts and online persona perfectly.",
