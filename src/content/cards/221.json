  "description": "minami is an ultrabie tier user with a solid following who posts about AI, programming, and personal frustrations, often venting sarcastically. Her ability mocks her knack for attracting long, pointless conversations that derail her productivity. Her attack references her salty tweets about family and annoying people, showing dramatic emotional outbursts. She resists psyop since she values clear, rational tech discussion and is immune to confusion tactics, but is weak to goon (direct confrontation) because aggressive pushback likely shuts down her rants. No furry content or LGBTQ+ themes present, so drama and psyop types dominate her profile. Her hit points reflect her ultrabie status, while attack damage matches the strength of her most reactive tweet themes.",
