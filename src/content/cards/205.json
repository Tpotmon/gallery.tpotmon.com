  "description": "Nemo's lowbie tier and modest follower base warrant a lower HP and attack damage. The ability mocks his vague 'Jack of trades, master of less' persona and an endless but ineffective quest to improve. His tweets frequently trail into confused, obscure or half-hearted takes, fitting the psyop type, as he clouds discussions without firm positions. His attack references this foggy style that generates little engagement or clarity. He is weak to roast because sharp criticism can pierce his imprecise facade, while resistant to cringe given most of his content avoids overt awkwardness, tending more toward bland or confused posts instead. The profile pic and banner do not indicate any furry or more niche themes, nor does his content, so furry or other types are not applied.",
