  "description": "wolke is a lowbie tier user with moderate engagement primarily focused on coding projects, tech frustrations, and casual travel snapshots. Their tweets reveal a nerdy, somewhat awkward vibe focused on automation and programming struggles, leading to a cringe-type attack. The sarcastic ability targets their scattered, half-baked tech attempts. They resist psyop attacks since their content is mostly straightforward but weak to roast critiques that expose their overhyped tech boasting. Given their profile picture with a wolf and mention of 'in the clouds,' the card reflects a low HP consistent with lowbie tier and a vibe of dreamy but unfocused effort.",
