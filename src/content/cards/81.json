  "description": "Ria's card is designed around her self-deprecating and lowbie tier vibe, reflected in a modest HP of 40. Her ability mocks her recurrent 'skill issue' theme that permeates her posts about coding and cooking‚Äîalways ironically self-sabotaging. The attack mimics her posting style, which is confusing and self-contradictory, loaded with half-hearted tech attempts and casual nonsensical tweets, fitting a psyop attack type. Since she tends to post in a way that can confuse or bemuse, she resists other psyop attacks somewhat. However, she is vulnerable to harsh, sharp criticism (roast) which cuts through her ironic wall of humor more effectively. The presence of cats and animal pictures in her tweets was noted, but since it is minimal and not a core theme, furry type was not chosen, favoring the more prominent psyop characterization.",
