  "description": "Aayush is a nanobie with low engagement but tries to seem deep with mix of motivational and self-help style tweets, often unclear or ironically unhelpful, which fits a psyop attack type. His low follower count and few likes warrant low hit points and attack damage. His ability ironically highlights his NPC/procrastination themes, common in his retweets and posts. Weakness to drama suits him as he doesn't engage in conflict, so controversy would throw him off. Resistant to psyop due to his own confusing style. No furry or other niche content present, so no other types chosen.",
