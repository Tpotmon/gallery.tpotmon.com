  "description": "This user has a 'nanobie' tier and a low follower count with mostly retweets of inspirational startup and app-building content, showing more consumption than creation. Their profile picture and banner are generic and non-animal themed. Their tweeting style is heavy on repetition of others' motivational thoughts, with little original or engaging content. Hence, their ability mocks their lack of originality. The attack is crafted around their prevalent retweeting and quoting of popular motivational content, showing off copy-paste behavior and lack of innovation. The attack is of 'cringe' type due to awkwardness of constant retweeting as personal branding. They are weak to 'roast' since sharp criticism can expose their lack of authenticity and originality easily. Resistant to 'cringe' because they are already entrenched in this behavior and not easily harmed by it.",
