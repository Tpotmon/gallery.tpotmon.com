  "attackDescription": "Garrett Arpin unleashes a barrage of dense, pseudo-intellectual AI and cognitive science jargon that confuses and bores opponents into submission â€” or just makes them question why they even showed up.",

  "description": "Garrett is a highbie tier user with a solid follower base and frequent thoughtful tweets about AI, philosophy, and nonconformity. His profile pics show a serious, thoughtful vibe, matching his intelligent yet somewhat pretentious tone. His ability mocks his nonconformist and somewhat elitist persona that dismisses normal social conventions. His attack reflects his dense AI jargon and intellectualism from tweets, which can bewilder and confuse opponents, hence the 'psyop' type. He is resistant to confusion/mind games (psyop) because he himself uses them confidently but is weak to direct aggressive confrontation (goon), which could break through his intellectual defenses. This fits his style of debating from a high horse but potentially crumbling when confronted plainly.",
