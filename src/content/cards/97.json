  "description": "The user's profile and tweets show a solo indie game dev grinding daily but complaining about heat, sleep deprivation, and depending on others (gf cooking breakfast). The ability mocks his reliance on others for basic needs. The attack roasts his typical programming rants with a pinch of self-neglect. Weakness to cringe fits his occasional awkward confessions about exhaustion and losing followers. Resistance to psyop fits his technical discussions and skepticism toward misinformation or hype in programming. The card is lowbie tier since the user is smaller but active and verified.",
