  "description": "This user is a lowbie tier with moderate followers and a very high amount of favorites and retweets, heavily relying on retweeting rather than original content, which suits the 'psyop' attack type, reflecting a confusing flood of other people's thoughts without much personal clarity. The ability mocks their retweet-heavy behavior. The attack pokes fun at their overwhelming RT activity with an ironic pun. They resist psyop-type because they're already immersed in confusing content themselves, but are weak to roast attacks that criticize their lack of originality. There's no evidence of animal/furry content, nor aggressive, thirsty, or dramatic behavior, so those types were not assigned.",
