  "description": "The hitPoints correspond to the user's highbie tier, granting 100 HP within the highbie range (80-120). The ability 'Cosmic Chef's Irony' draws on Jirachi's elaborate and humorous culinary tweet about eating PokÃ©mon, reflecting a refined yet ironically cold delivery of content. The attack 'Remilio Roast' references the user's recurring theme of associating with 'Remilio' and their self-aware roasting style, including admitted tweet stealing and ironic bravado, which suits the roast attack type well. Weakness to psyop attacks fits given their penchant for ironic and confusing statements that could be flipped by manipulative mind games. Resistance to cringe aligns with their high follower count and polished but sarcastic tone, indicating immunity to embarrassment or awkwardness. The furry type was not selected as there is no clear animal-theme beyond PokÃ©mon culinary references, which is more humorous than furry community related.",
