  "description": "This card is lowbie tier with moderate HP matching Imre's modest but verified presence. The ability mocks his obsession with niche tech topics that few comprehend, reflected in his tweets about obscure tech moves and anti-corporate sentiments. The attack targets his posting style, especially the over-shared anti-Microsoft and tech conspiracy content that confuses most but gains some traction in niche circles, hence the psyop type. Weakness is roast because sharp criticism would cut through his confusing tech babble. He resists psyop attacks since confusing content is his norm and strength. The lack of animal themes or queer content rules out furry or gay types, and he doesn't appear aggressive or dramatic enough for those types either.",
