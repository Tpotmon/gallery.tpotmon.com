  "description": "Hibakod's card is shaped by their ultrabie tier and rare status, granting them sturdy hit points. Their ability mocks their own admission of having a network yet never using it constructively. The main attack highlights their tendency to shitpost ironically and self-deprecatingly, often with tweets teasing their lack of serious value despite having influential followers. This roast-type attack fits their sarcastic and critical tone. Given their behavior, they're weak against 'psyop' attacks that bring confusion or mind games, breaking their witty self-control. Their resistance to 'roast' reflects how they thrive amid sharp commentary, often dishing it out and shrugging off others' criticism. There was no indication of animal/furry content, so that type was correctly omitted, and the attack and ability reflect their tweeting persona and content style.",
