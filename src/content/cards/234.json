  "description": "The user is an ultrabie with a strong tech-focused presence centered around TypeScript, React, and developer tools. The ability sarcastically jabs at the stereotypical 'object Object' confusion in JavaScript/TypeScript, matching their tech vibe. Their strongest attack is based on their frequent React and coding posts, which can confuse opponents with nerdy complexity, fitting the psyop type perfectly. They resist similar confusing or manipulative content but are weak to sharp criticism (roast) that calls out their tech post pretentiousness. There is no furry content, so no furry type assigned.",
