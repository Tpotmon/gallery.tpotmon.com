  "description": "The user heavily relies on retweets and reposting viral media, showing a pattern of low original content but high engagement through others' posts, fitting a cringe attack type with moderate damage for a lowbie tier. Ability mocks the obsessive retweeting nature for visibility. Weakness to 'roast' reflects vulnerability to sharp criticism since their content lacks original strength. Resistance to 'cringe' shows some tolerance to awkward/embarrassing content due to their frequent engagement with meme and viral posts. The profile and tweets show no animal/furry or aggressive bullying patterns, so types like 'furry' or 'goon' are inappropriate. The low hit points align with their low follower count and common tier.",
