  "description": "Vry is a highbie tier user tweeting technical crypto and coding grind content with occasional frustration and grind motivation. The ability mocks his persistent overwork and ignoring easier escapes. The attack reflects his repetitive bug and market whining that tires out any chance of engagement, fitting a psyop type since his posts can frustrate and confuse. He strongly resists similar psyop confusion but is weak to drama as emotional conflict and controversy would break his calm grind-focused facade. No animal/furry content was found. The hit points and damage align with the highbie tier and decent follower base.",
