  "description": "Based on the lowbie tier, hit points and attack damage are on the lower side. Ability 'Quantum Confusion' reflects their heavy use of cryptic, metaphorical tweets about quantum behaviors and obscure concepts, confusing the audience. Attack 'Emoji Blackout' mocks their complaint about chat reactions disappearing unnoticed in a flood of messages, symbolizing their subtle but ultimately ineffective attempts at engagement. The attack type is 'psyop' due to their confusing and metaphorical posting style. Weakness is 'roast' since criticism and sharp commentary counters their obscure and sometimes pretentious content well. They resist 'psyop' because their content often embraces confusion deliberately. There is no strong furry presence despite some animal mentions (rhinos), so 'furry' type is not assigned. Overall, the card captures Mind Worm as a confusing, obscure low tier user with low but tricky damage potential.",
