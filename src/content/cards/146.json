  "description": "Dishant is a lowbie tier coder who shares intense, sometimes brutally honest programming advice, often calling out laziness and lack of discipline in the dev community, which fits perfectly with a roast attack type. His ability sarcastically mocks his tone of 'just practice harder' coding advice. He resists roast-type attacks due to his own biting commentary but is weak to drama as he prefers straightforwardness over emotional conflicts. No furry or other niche themes were present in profile or tweets, so roast and drama were most fitting. Hit points set low-mid to represent lowbie tier with moderate influence (667 followers).",
