  "description": "Astro chan's card reflects their 'lowbie' tier with modest HP. Their sarcasm-filled ability mocks the incessant 'good morning' and 'felt cute' posts littered with 'uwu' and 'baka,' expressing an ironic jab at their overdone cutesy persona. Their primary attack, 'E-Stalk Slam,' builds on their behavior of repeatedly posting about e-stalking and making unwanted advances with an awkward, thirst-driven tone. This fits the 'thirst' attack type perfectly due to the suggestive and clingy text style. The user is weak to 'roast' because sharp criticism and biting commentary would quickly dismantle their fragile cuteness act. They resist 'cringe' humor due to being already deeply entrenched in awkward and embarrassing posting styles. Although they post some animals/furry references, the core content is dominated by thirst and cutesy anime-style posts, so 'thirst' is a more suitable attack type than 'furry.' Their profile picture and banner do not significantly emphasize furry themes either.",
