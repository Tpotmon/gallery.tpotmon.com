  "description": "The card has low hit points reflecting Paul's nanobie tier and modest follower count. The ability sarcastically references his AI/ML focus but pokes fun at how he often confuses more than clarifies. The attack draws from his self-pun 'MasterbAIted' post, which is a highlight of his cringe humor. His weakness is roast type, as direct sharp commentary would undermine his awkward attempts at wit. He resists psyop attacks because his content is largely straightforward and not deliberately manipulative. There is no furry or animal-themed content, nor aggressive or drama-driven posts. The card captures his modest engagement and self-deprecating vibe with a blend of cringe and subtle tech sarcasm.",
