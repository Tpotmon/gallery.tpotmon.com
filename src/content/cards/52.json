  "description": "With a megabie tier reflecting a strong influential presence (29,667 followers, high engagement), the hitPoints are set high. The ability pokes fun at the user's ongoing legal battles in South Korea for 'writing true things,' ironically turning setbacks into power. The attack embodies their sharp, cutting critiques of crypto scams and questionable research, showcasing the user's sarcastic and brutally honest style. Roast type fits their critical, sarcastic commentary well. Weakness to drama due to involvement in public controversies and legal issues, while resistance to roast suits their resilience and prolific cutting commentary that likely dulls others' criticism.",
