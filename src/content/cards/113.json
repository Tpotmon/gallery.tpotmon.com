  "description": "Observer is a highbie tier user with a strong presence and a verified status, which translates into relatively high hit points. The ability ironically mocks the user's dependence on tech/AI themes and meme culture for clout. Their attack is based on frequent posting of semi-technical and meme content, often spamming followers with overwhelming posts, suitable for a psyop type. Their weakness is roast type, as sharp criticism would pierce their hyped-up tech persona easily. They resist psyop attacks better due to their own manipulative and ambiguous messaging style. No furry or LGBTQ+ content was noted, so those types were excluded. The profile pictures and tweets show a tech-savvy yet meme-driven style with ironic and sarcastic posts, reinforcing the psyop and roast dynamics.",
