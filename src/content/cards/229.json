  "description": "Q is a megabie tier card with high HP reflecting their solid influence and expert status in AI and applied science. The ability mocks their dense tech jargon and sometimes confusing overanalysis, which ironically complicates communication. The attack draws from their highly specialized tweets about LLMs, AI models, and coding setups, which can flummox normal followers—perfect for a psyop type attack. Their weakness is roast, as sharp criticism and biting commentary can cut through their tech-elitist facade and call out their own contradictions. They resist psyop as they themselves excel at cryptic, manipulative tech talk. The profile pictures and content had no animal or furry references, so furry type was not assigned despite a cat pun tweet. This balances their card type diversity fittingly as a psyop specialist.",
