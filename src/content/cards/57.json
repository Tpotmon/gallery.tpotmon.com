  "description": "With under 20 followers and low engagement, TruckerKun fits a lowbie tier with minimal hit points. Their tweets show a mix of road-related content and occasional harsh insults, indicating a goon attack style with some aggression but low impact. Their sarcastic and slightly hostile tone inspired the ability 'Lonely Gunner'. The strongest attack reflects their harsh road rage moment, which while aggressive, lacks real power or reach. They resist psyop-type attacks due to a straightforward no-nonsense attitude and weakly withstand sharp roasts themselves, making roast their primary weakness. No furry or queer content present; goon and roast types best fit their profile.",
