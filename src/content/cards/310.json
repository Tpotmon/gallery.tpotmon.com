  "description": "Hermit is a lowbie tier user with modest hit points reflecting their moderate follower count and engagement. The ability 'Hermit Mode: Activated' sarcastically points out the contradiction between the user's name/profile image and their abundant, overshared life details. The attack, 'Hermit's Lackluster Roar', draws from their awkward flirtations and self-aware but underwhelming humor, categorized under 'cringe' for the occasional uncomfortable or awkward content. Weakness to 'roast' type fits because sharp criticism would easily tackle their thinly veiled attempts at coolness, while resistance to 'cringe' reflects their comfort zone of posting low-key awkward jokes and memes without losing followers. The user posts some animal content (kittens, deer/fawns) but it is not the main theme and doesn't dominate enough for 'furry' type. Content balance steers clear of other types.",
