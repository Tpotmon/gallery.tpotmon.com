  "description": "The user brands themselves an 'AI supremacist' ironically while heavily engaging in tech and coding discussions, so their ability mocks their contradiction. Their main attack is a sarcastic roast combining tech critiques and meme culture from their tweets, especially the 'I don't use AI' line and coding posts. They resist roast attacks because they dish out sharp commentary often but are weak to psyop tactics due to potential confusion from their stubborn, contrarian stance. The lowbie tier assigns hitPoints to the lower midrange (35) and attackDamage accordingly. No furry or other niche type fits as they do not post animal or queer content. Their sarcastic style fits roast well.",
