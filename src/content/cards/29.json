  "description": "Shiro is a highbie tier user with a moderate follower count and a verified account, posting a mix of tech, gaming, and random life thoughts. Their style is eclectic and often indirect, with many retweets and viral content shares. Their ability reflects their scattered ADHD-influenced posting style, ironically suggesting they confuse followers and themselves alike. The attack mocks their heavy reliance on viral retweets and amplified content rather than original tweeting, hitting like a psyop because it messes with what people believe is original content. The card is weak to roast attacks because direct criticism and sharp commentary would puncture their fragile recycled-content shield. It resists psyop because they already thrive in confusion and manipulation of narrative. There's no furry or explicit animal content, so no furry type is assigned. The HP and damage fit the highbie tier range, representing a somewhat established but not mega-influential presence.",
