  "description": "Poop wah is a highbie tier user with a moderate follower base and a high post count of personal and casual content, often ironic and self-deprecating. Their ability mocks their contradictory behavior of 'doing nothing' yet constantly posting, reflecting procrastination satire. The attack references their viral tweet complaining about forced social interaction, highlighting their awkward, cringe social presence. Cringe is appropriate due to the awkwardness and casual vibe of their posts. They resist cringe well due to embracing it as humor and personality. They are weak to goon types who confront directly, as Poop Wah avoids confrontation and social pressure, making aggressive opposition effective.",
