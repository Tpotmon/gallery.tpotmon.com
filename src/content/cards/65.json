  "description": "Daniel Merja is a highbie tier tech founder tweeting about AI startups, industry trends, and some critical takes with moderate traction. The ability mocks the tech bubble skepticism and startup burnout vibe. The attack is based on his recurring theme of nostalgic open source admiration and 'magical' tech revelations, roasts him for feeling like a cranky wise old coder who thinks he's unique. His weakness to drama fits because his tweets avoid emotional online conflicts and can be rattled by controversy. He's resistant to roast type since he dishes out sarcastic roasts himself. No furry or other types are relevant since his photos and content do not show animal or LGBTQ+ themes.",
