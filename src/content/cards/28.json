  "description": "scri₿e is a lowbie tier with moderate hit points near the bottom of the range due to low follower engagement despite high tweet counts. Their profile and tweets show a penchant for confusing, sarcastic, and controversial commentary with vague or ironic posts often lacking clear meaning, which fits a psyop attack type as their content manipulates follower perception and causes confusion. The ability mocks this unclear communication style. Their highest engagement comes from odd or confusing hot takes, so the attack reflects that. They resist psyop attacks due to familiarity but are weak to roast attacks that challenge their credibility and sarcasm. No furry or LGBTQ+ content observed, so those types aren't applied.",
