  "description": "J0nnyðŸ¥³ is a low-tier software engineer with a small following but a large volume of highly technical tweets filled with obscure debugging and hardware projects, often sharing chaotic or 'sketchy' tech builds. The ability 'Code Overload' sarcastically mocks his incessant and overwhelming tech posts. His attack 'J0nny's Debugging Disaster' roasts his penchant for posting convoluted and buggy setups that likely confuse most readers, fitting the cringe type well because his posts sometimes appear awkward or out-of-touch for casual audiences. Due to his tech focus and some confusing posts, he's resistant to psyop type attacks (mind games), but his weakness is roast, meaning sharp criticism and biting commentary can effectively counter him.",
