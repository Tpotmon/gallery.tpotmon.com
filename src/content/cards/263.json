  "description": "This user is categorized as 'highbie' with 95 hp reflecting a decent presence. Their content is deeply philosophical, AI-centered, and artistic with cryptic themes, matching a psyop attack type that confuses and mystifies. The ability mocks their orbiting, cryptic style ironically. The attack roasts their aimless intellectual wandering. They resist psyop type due to their affinity for confusing, AI-based content but are weak to roast criticism which would cut through their pretentious ambiguity.",
