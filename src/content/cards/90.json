  "description": "Kaden's highbie tier with 110 HP reflects his solid but not invincible status as a Junior Full-Stack Engineer and CS Senior. His ability mocks his own admitted choice paralysis and his scattered interests in AI, game theory, and programming. The attack references his most liked tweet about the '9/11 for tpot' and other sarcastic, chaotic tech commentary, fitting a 'psyop' type due to his complex and confusing tech discourse. He resists psyop-type confusion due to his technical mindset but is weak to goon aggressive confrontations that cut through his verbal indecision. There was no furry or animal content in his profile or tweets to assign that type, and the sarcasm and roasting style fits well with psyop rather than drama or roast. The attack damage and HP scale appropriately for his follower count and engagement.",
