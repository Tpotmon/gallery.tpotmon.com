  "description": "Given Asutosh's self-described 'Noob' tier and beginner-level tech posts with modest follower count and interactions, the card is lowbie tier with low hit points. The ability sarcastically mocks his 'Tier-3 Rebel' persona and unsure direction in tech. His attack reflects his earnest but often awkward coding and tech advice posts, making it a cringe-type attack. He is weak to roast attacks because sharp criticism can pierce through his amateurish facade, but somewhat resistant to cringe since he feeds off that vibe. No furry or niche types apply as no animal or anthro content is present. Overall, this card embodies a hopeful but painfully novice tech enthusiast.",
