  "description": "This user primarily retweets politically charged and controversial content, showing a strong drama type tendency by stirring conflict through amplification of contentious topics. Their ability ironically mocks their lack of original tweets, relying heavily on retweets. The attack targets their repetitive, drama-driven posting style, aptly named to roast their predictability. They resist drama well due to their consistent engagement in it but are weak to roast attacks, as sharp criticism would undermine their credibility and trustworthiness.",
