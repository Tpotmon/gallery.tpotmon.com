  "description": "The user is a lowbie tier with moderate followers and tweets heavily about tech, philosophy, and dry sarcasm. Their profile picture and cover don't indicate any furry or LGBTQ+ themes, so those types are inappropriate. The sarcastic, self-aware style fits a psyop type — posting confusing, ironic takes and tech rants that could mislead or perplex. Their weakness is goon type, as direct aggressive criticism or confrontation would counter their ironic stance. They resist psyop attacks best due to their own confusing style. The attack name references their philosophical irony and tech screwups, while the ability name highlights their ironic confident persona who self-jabs about being a tech screwup and not watching movies. Hit points are set on low end for lowbie tier. Attack damage reflects moderate traction but not highly viral content.",
