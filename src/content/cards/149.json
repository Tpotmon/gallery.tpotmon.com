  "description": "Raj Gupta is a lowbie tier user with moderate follower count and active engagement mostly by retweeting popular content rather than creating original posts. His profile picture and banner show a professional vibe but the tweet history reveals a tendency to amplify others' content (RTs) rather than innovating. This inspired the sarcastic ability 'Retweet Reliance' poking fun at his dependence on others' posts. The attack 'Raj's Echo Chamber' reflects his heavy retweeting and repetitive sharing, which is cringe-worthy and low-impact but persistent. His attack type is 'cringe' because his posts sometimes come off awkward and unoriginal. He is weak to 'roast' type attacks that call out his lack of original contribution and resistant to 'cringe' attacks as he is already acclimated to that style and doesn't lose further strength from it. This combination fits his tweeting behavior and profile perfectly.",
