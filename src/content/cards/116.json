  "description": "Craine’s Workshop is an ultrabie-tier waifu dealer, specializing in anime waifu art and nostalgic anime references, justifying a high HP in the upper mid-range. The ability sarcastically jabs at their obsessive waifu postings that ultimately flood and annoy. The attack name calls out their most popular waifu art (Deedlit) and mocks how their posts trap people in pointless anime debates that no one wins. The furry attack type fits because of the heavy focus on anime characters, many from fantasy or animal-like beings, embodying anthropomorphic aesthetics common in furry culture. Weakness to roast is chosen to counter the heavy waifu hype by sharp criticism and sarcastic commentary. Resistance to psyop makes sense as their posts are straightforward anime appreciation, resisting confusion or mind games. This balance keeps the card true to their content style with a playful yet biting roast tone.",
