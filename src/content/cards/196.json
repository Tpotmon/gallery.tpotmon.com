  "description": "Krish is a nanobie tier user with low HP reflecting their modest follower count and limited influence. Their ability sarcastically mocks their self-proclaimed hidden artist talent contrasted with their mostly low-impact tweets. Their attack is based on their frequent low-engagement, awkward tech-humor style posts and insecure commentary, making the cringe type appropriate. They are weak to roast type, symbolizing how sharp criticism can effectively counter their thin skin and low confidence. They resist cringe modestly, as they are used to awkward, embarrassing content and so it doesn't hit them as hard. There is no furry content in profile picture or tweets, and no strong evidence of other types, so cringe fits best for their style of content.",
