  "description": "Billy B. Brodríguez is a nanobie tier user with modest hit points reflecting lower influence. The ability mocks his self-proclaimed 'acc Drunk/acc Autist' label, which he uses as ironic excuses. The attack focuses on his cringe-worthy behavior shown in awkward rants and embarrassing tweets, hence the 'cringe' attack type with lower damage since traction is low despite some viral retweets. Weakness to 'roast' suits the user's vulnerability to sharp criticism given his defensive posture. He resists 'cringe' type slightly, reflecting some tolerance for awkwardness in his content. No furry content was present, so that type was not assigned. Overall, the card roasts his awkward, self-deprecating online persona and his low-tier impact.",
