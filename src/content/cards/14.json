  "description": "With a lowbie tier and modest hit points, Fléurdelys reflects a casual VRChat player who posts animal-themed content such as leaf-eating photos, justifying the furry attack type and resistance. Their ability mocks their overuse of VR and health condition as a shield. Their weakness to goons aligns with vulnerability to aggressive confrontation, breaking their virtual bubble. The card balances the user's genuine but niche online presence and small but engaged audience.",
