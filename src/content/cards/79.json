  "description": "compact set is a highbie tier user with strong engagement, especially in reply-heavy, analytic, and dating discourse content. Her ability mocks her compulsive reply-girl behavior, flooding threads with replies and forcing interaction. Her attack targets the cringe in her overanalyzed, overly personal posts about dating and stats, reflecting her posting style that mixes self-deprecation with humor but can come off as awkward or much. She is resistant to cringe since she thrives in those awkward, relatable posts but weak to roast because sharp criticism directly undercuts her love for witty yet sometimes embarrassing commentary. The card is a highbie with mid-level hp reflecting solid presence but not overwhelming dominance. Cringe fits best for attack type given her awkward but engaging posting style. No animal or furry content was detected, so furry type is not assigned.",
