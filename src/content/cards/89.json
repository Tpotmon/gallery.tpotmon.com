  "description": "Furt_Tech is a highbie tier user with 1050 followers, known for deep technical content on programming (C, embedded systems, cyber security) mixed with personal struggles and humorous mechanical woes. His tweets show passionate, sometimes contradictory takes on coding and tech culture, generating a confusing and sarcastic aura, perfect for a psyop type attack. His ability humorously mirrors his persona as an 'Encrypted Waffle' scrambling communications. The strongest attack references his specific obsession with memory management and C code, reflecting his core content. His weakness to roast fits because sharp criticism and direct mockery would pierce through his tech-guarded persona, while he resists psyop attacks due to his own manipulative and confusing style. There is no indication of animal/furry content, so furry type is not applicable. The hitPoints and attackDamage fit the highbie tier ranges.",
