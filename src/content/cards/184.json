  "description": "Guneal is a nanobie tier generalist artist mostly sharing daily sketches ('da mornin dood') and musings with very low engagement, fitting a low HP of 30. The ability mocks their endless deep-sounding but ultimately dry posts about vision and art. Their attack is based on their repetitive morning doodles that hardly gain attention, making it a cringe type. The player resists cringe attacks slightly because they are used to their own awkward posting style, but they are weak to roast type attacks, which can expose their lack of influence and dry content. No furry or other niche thematic content was found, so cringe fits best for attack type. Overall, the card jabs at their low impact despite their artistic ambition and repetitive posting.",
