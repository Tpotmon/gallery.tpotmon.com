The attack hones in on their frequent retweets and moots (a term they used themselves), which often add little value but attempt to appear profound—aptly classified as a 'psyop' attack for their somewhat confusing and intellectual overlay. They are resistant to psyop due to their focus on knowledge and discussion but weak to roast since cutting criticism and sharp commentary would upset their intellectual facade, exposing their less impactful content. The user does not post animal or furry content, so no furry type is assigned despite some dog story retweets.

The attack is based on his frequent retweets and low-engagement anime and movie posts, which come off as cringeworthy rather than impactful, hence a low damage and cringe type. He's weak to sharp criticism (roast) because his content lacks strong original commentary and could be easily pierced by it. He's moderately resistant to psyop attacks due to the somewhat confusing and scattered nature of his posts making manipulative tactics less effective.","1549984440432185345","src/content/cards/25.json","9c01d481ab334ce1","251",{"id":3050,"data":3052,"filePath":3066,"digest":3067},{"id":3053,"displayName":3054,"username":3055,"isBlueVerified":16,"followers":3056,"following":3057,"hitPoints":705,"profilePicUrl":3058,"bannerPicUrl":3059,"fullArtUrl":50,"cardType":51,"tier":311,"abilityName":3060,"abilityDescription":3061,"attackName":3062,"attackDescription":3063,"attackType":101,"attackDamage":102,"weaknessType":31,"weaknessAmount":102,"resistType":101,"resistAmount":102,"description":3064,"rarity":318,"holo":16,"xId":3065},251,"Kion","WagieWeeb",4174,1859,"/pfp/251.jpg","/banner/251.jpg","Cringe Overload","Kion's ability to flood the battlefield with so much self-proclaimed cringe that opponents become too embarrassed to attack effectively.","WagieWeeb Wreck","Unleashes a barrage of painfully awkward memes and relentless self-deprecation, leaving foes questioning why they even engaged with Kion in the first place.","Kion is an ultrabie tier user with a large following and active engagement, mostly centered around creating a cringe-filled, self-aware persona. The ability 'Cringe Overload' mocks their admission as a 'Cringe lord' and how their content aggressively embraces awkwardness. The attack 'WagieWeeb Wreck' taps into their pattern of self-deprecating humor and meme-heavy posts that are highly cringe-worthy but also form their main content style. Their attack is strong reflecting decent traction on posts. The weakness to 'roast' type is a jab at how sharp criticism undermines their cringe armor, while resistance to 'cringe' reflects their comfort in that content style.

Hence, the ability mocks their copy-paste nature with \"Serial Retweeter.\" The attack name \"Carlosfpg Copy-Paste\" directly references this behavior and sarcastically points out the lack of original commentary while still sharing viral posts. The attack type is 'psyop' because retweets include manipulative or confusing geopolitical information and memes that can mislead or saturate feeds with mixed messages.\n\nWeakness is 'roast' because direct criticism and sharp commentary can cut through the passive retweeting persona, challenging the user's echoing pattern. Resistance is also 'psyop' as the user seems comfortable in confusing or manipulative content streams, showing resilience against such mind games.\n\nNo furry or animal themes were detected in profile or media; content is primarily political and meme retweets.

Their profile and tweets heavily involve robotics, coding struggles, and self-deprecating humor about physical mishaps during projects, inspiring the 'Infinite Buffer Overflow' ability as a sarcastic nod to their mental overload and debugging chaos. The attack 'Robot Meltdown' is tailored from their frequent posts about project setbacks, burns, and code frustration, delivered with cringe-worthy vulnerability.

He resists psyop-type confusion due to his technical mindset but is weak to goon aggressive confrontations that cut through his verbal indecision.
